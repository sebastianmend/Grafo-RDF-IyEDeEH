  "abstract": "Environmental monitoring is essential for addressing critical issues such as climate change, pollution, and resource depletion. The incorporation of advanced technologies has paved the way for sustainable resource management, transforming traditional approaches. This review highlights key technologies, including IoT-enabled sensors, satellite-based remote sensing, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain systems, that enhance environmental data collection, processing, and application. IoT facilitates real-time monitoring of air quality, water resources, and soil health, while satellite imagery and GIS tools provide large-scale insights into land-use changes and ecosystem dynamics. AI enables predictive modeling for resource optimization, and blockchain ensures transparency and accountability in environmental compliance. Applications of these technologies extend across diverse fields: air quality management benefits from pollutant detection and hotspot prediction; water resource management is revolutionized through real-time quality monitoring; biodiversity conservation employs AI-powered tools for wildlife tracking; and precision agriculture enhances productivity while minimizing environmental impact. Despite their transformative potential, challenges such as implementation costs, data privacy, and technological gaps persist. Future research should focus on affordable, scalable solutions and collaborative frameworks. These technologies represent a paradigm shift in environmental stewardship, offering innovative pathways to sustainability and resilience across sectors.",
