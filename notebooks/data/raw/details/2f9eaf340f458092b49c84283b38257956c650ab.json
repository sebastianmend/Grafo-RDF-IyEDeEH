  "abstract": "By collecting real time data on weather, soil and air quality, crop maturity, Precision agriculture (PA) has become an emerging topic in recent years. Management zone delineation is the major task in PA, which could help to discover the spatially contiguous zones of the field. This article studies the different data mining approaches for achieving management zone delineation with their advantages and disadvantages.",
