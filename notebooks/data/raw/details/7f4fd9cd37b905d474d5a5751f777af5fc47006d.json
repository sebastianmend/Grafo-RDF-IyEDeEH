  "abstract": "Advances in genome editing technology have revolutionized basic and applied biology research in recent years, particularly due to the newly emerged CRISPR/Cas technique (Ren et al., 2017b). The classical CRISPR/Cas system was derived from a bacterial defense system, which consists of a single guide RNA (sgRNA) for precise targeting and one Cas protein for DNA binding and nuclease activity. Relying on high precision of CRISPR/Cas system, multiple functions have been exploited in addition to original nuclease activity, such as genome base editing, gene knock-down and activation, chromatin imaging systems etc. (Barrangou and Doudna, 2016; Wang and Qi, 2016). These extensions have demonstrated the flexibility of the CRISPR/Cas system as it has boosted basic biological, biomedical and agricultural research (Shen et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017). Here we summarize some key events in CRISPR/Cas system development, provide a glimpse of how this technology has transformed biological research, and help you to choose the right tool for your own research (Fig. 1). CRISPR/Cas system was first introduced into human 293FT cells where it was shown to cleave target sites with high efficiency. The resulting double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in genomic DNA were partially repaired by the indel-forming nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway (Cong et al., 2013); therefore indels (insertions/deletions) and base mutations may present within the target site, which could deactivate the target gene and achieve in vivo gene knockout. The convenience and precision of this technique has",
