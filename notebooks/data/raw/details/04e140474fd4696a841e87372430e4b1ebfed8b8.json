  "abstract": "With the advent of IoT, industry 4.0 and precision agriculture an increasing interest has been devoted to sensors and transducers based on new materials and eco-friendly technologies. Recently, Bacterial Cellulose (BC) has been investigated as an intriguing solution for the realization of green devices and electronics. BC has excellent mechanical properties, it is fully biodegradable and greener then classical plant-derived cellulose. In this paper we investigate the influence of the geometry of BC based compounds on their mechano-eletrical transduction capability. An experimental campaign has been addressed obtaining very intriguing results.",
