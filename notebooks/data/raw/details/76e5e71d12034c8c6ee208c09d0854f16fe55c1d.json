  "abstract": "Managing the agricultural sector by exploiting technology facilitates the productivity as well as diminishes unintended wastages and manual inaccuracies. In this paper, algorithms for detection of weeds, pest and disease affected leaves in a maize field are presented. Shape and size analysis techniques are used for weed detection while thresholding methods are used for pest and disease affected leaves detection. The algorithms can be used in systems to enable automated precision agriculture in maize fields.",
