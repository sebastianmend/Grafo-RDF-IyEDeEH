  "abstract": "This paper, provided by the authors, focuses on the prospects for the development of wine tourism in the southern regions of the Russian Federation. Unlike a beach holiday, for obvious reasons unpopular in winter, wine tourism is a year-round phenomenon. The most important factor in the successful development of this type of business is familiarizing tourists with the latest technologies in winemaking and viticulture. These technologies are based on digitization of agriculture, the introduction of elements of precision farming, digital mapping and yield planning, parallel driving systems, Internet of Things (IoT), the use of unmanned tractors (combines) and robotics.",
