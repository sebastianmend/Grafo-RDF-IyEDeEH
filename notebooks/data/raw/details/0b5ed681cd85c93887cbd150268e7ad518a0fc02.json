  "abstract": "The convergence of nanotechnology, biotechnology, and genomics is reshaping the landscape of scientific research and innovation, offering unprecedented opportunities to address complex biological and medical challenges. Nanotechnology provides tools and materials at the nanoscale that enhance the sensitivity, precision, and functionality of biotechnological and genomic applications. This integration enables targeted drug delivery systems, highly sensitive nanosensors, advanced gene editing, and rapid genomic sequencing, thereby accelerating the development of personalized medicine and precision agriculture. The synergy between these fields fosters novel diagnostic, therapeutic, and environmental solutions that are more efficient and cost-effective than conventional methods. However, the amalgamation of nanotechnology with biotechnology and genomics also raises technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges, including biocompatibility, nanoparticle toxicity, data privacy, and equitable access. This paper reviews key advances in nanotech-enabled biotechnology and genomics, illustrates impactful case studies, and discusses emerging trends such as AI-driven nanomaterial design and synthetic biology integration. It further addresses the hurdles to commercialization and societal acceptance, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration and responsible innovation. By providing a comprehensive overview, the paper aims to guide future research, policy, and industry efforts to harness the full potential of this interdisciplinary convergence, ultimately contributing to global health, sustainability, and technological progress.",
