  "abstract": "1-Triacontanol (TRIA) is gaining a lot of interest in agricultural practice due to its use as bio-stimulant and different types of TRIA-containing products have been presented on the market. Up to date, TRIA determination is performed by GC analysis after chemical derivatization, but in aqueous samples containing low amounts of TRIA determination can be problematic and the derivatization step can be troublesome. Hence, there is the need for an analysis method without derivatization. TRIA-based products are in general plant extracts that can be obtained with different extraction procedures. These products can contain different ranges of concentration of TRIA from units to thousands of mg/kg. Thus, there is the need for a method that can be applied to different sample matrices like plant materials and different plant extracts. In this paper we present a HPLC-ELSD method for the analysis of TRIA without derivatization. The method has been fully validated and it has been tested analyzing the content of TRIA in different dried vegetal matrices, plant extracts, and products. The method is characterized by high sensitivity (LOD = 0.2 mg/L, LOQ = 0.6 mg/L) and good precision (intra-day: <11.2%, inter-day: 10.2%) being suitable for routine analysis of this fatty alcohol both for quality control or research purposes.",
