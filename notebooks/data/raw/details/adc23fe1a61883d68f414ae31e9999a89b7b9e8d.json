  "abstract": "Today the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or also known as drones are used for many operations in agriculture for enhancing the crop yield and reducing the cost of production. UAV application in agriculture leverages the economy of farmers. The UAV powered by solar or wind mounted with imaging processing capabilities and other devices will enable efficient operations like crop monitoring, spraying of fertilizers and chemical. UAV are extensively used in precision farming in developed counties. The authors have carried out the review of literature on the applications of UAV in agricultural across the world.",
