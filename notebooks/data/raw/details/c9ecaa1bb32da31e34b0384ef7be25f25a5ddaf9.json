  "abstract": "A wireless sensor node is typically battery operated and energy constrained. Therefore, it is apparent that optimal energy management is one of the most important challenges in WSN development. However, energy management requires in-depth knowledge and detailed insight concerning specific scenarios. After Carrying out a large number of experiments in precision agriculture, we find that it is the sensors that have never been concerned consuming the most energy of the node. In order to conserve energy and prolong the lifetime of WSN, we design and carry out a dynamic energy management strategy for sensors. The basic idea is to shut down all sensors’ power when not needed and wake them up when necessary. Valuable conclusions are extracted and analyzed.",
