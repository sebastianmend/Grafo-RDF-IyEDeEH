  "abstract": "The monitoring of agricultural soils has become a necessary need for good soil quality. For this reason several parameters have been studied to solve problems in agriculture. On the other hand we find several tools for this monitoring, generally the most known are based on UAVs. In this article we will focus on evaluating the two most known parameters the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The evaluation of these parameters was done in a heterogeneous embedded ODROID-XU4 architecture based on two CPUs and a GPU.",
