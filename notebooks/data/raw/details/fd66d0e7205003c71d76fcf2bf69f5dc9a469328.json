  "abstract": "Estimation of a future agricultural production is an important challenge for farmers. In this paper, we propose a system based on machine learning algorithms to estimate farm yields. The experiments were conducted on a Sorghum field. We use TensorFlow with Convolutional Neural Networks and Linear Regression. These algorithms allow us 1) to detect the different ears of Sorghum on an image and 2) to estimate their weight. On our dataset, we obtain an average accuracy of 74,5% for the detection of sorghum and an average precision of 99% for the estimation of the weight.",
