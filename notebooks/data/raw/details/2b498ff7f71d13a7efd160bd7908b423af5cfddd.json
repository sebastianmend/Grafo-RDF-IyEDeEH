  "abstract": "Precision agriculture is a farming management concept based on observing, measuring and responding to inter and intra-field variability in crops. By collecting real-time data on weather, soil and air quality, crop maturity and other factors, predictive analytics can be used to make better decisions for the future. This paper proposes a low power, low cost, robust data collection system to generate and gather data autonomously in isolated or remote areas. The sensor module collects soil moisture and temperature data and air temperature and humidity data that is then gathered periodically by a line following robot that uploads the stored data from the sensor module via Bluetooth communication for further analysis.",
