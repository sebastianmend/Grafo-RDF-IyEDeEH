  "abstract": "The paper presents the Murros Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) and its integration in IoT. Murros UAS is a multisensorial robotic system used for aerial monitoring of wireless sensors network in precision agriculture. This document details the software and hardware architecture of Murros UAS Ground Control Station and common situations when we are operating in an over-the-internet configuration. Experimental results are obtained from real missions.",
