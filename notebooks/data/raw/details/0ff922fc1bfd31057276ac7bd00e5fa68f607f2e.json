  "abstract": "Abstract: Ontario agricultural service providers were surveyed on their use of precision agricultural technologies. Global positioning systems are the most commonly adopted, while adoption rates for variable rate systems are significantly less. Enhancing adoption requires turning the vast amount of data collected on crop production into valuable decisions for the farmer.",
