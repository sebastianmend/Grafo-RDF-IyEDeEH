  "abstract": "\n A low-cost and multi-functional ground mobile robot is presented for precision agricultural application. A modified toy car is used as the hardware platform, and robotic operating system (ROS) as the software platform. By adding sensors and end effector, the robot can be controlled remotely. Our vision is to build an autonomous in-field service robot to realize some specific tasks instead of farmers.",
