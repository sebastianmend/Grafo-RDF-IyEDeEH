  "abstract": "The evolution of smart farming and precision agriculture during the last decades has led to an increase of the available solutions that can be used by farmers. However, these two paradigms have not yet achieved high acceptance by end user farmers due to various reasons. In this respect, this paper elaborates on an innovative Multi-Actor Approach architecture that assists farmers to take better decisions and enables them to harness the full value of their own data and knowledge aiming to promote the adoption of the Internet of Things in the agrifood sector.",
