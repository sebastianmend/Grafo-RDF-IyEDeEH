  "abstract": "Nowadays, IoT technologies are now implemented into a smart-farm production. Many sensors were developed and implemented into the agricultural production. GPS is one of the most used sensor even the cost of high accuracy GPS or RTK-GPS is still high. Fortunately, the cost of single unit GPS is significantly decreased. Main objective of this research is to evaluate the precision of the low-cost GPS in the performance perspective in smart farm tractor applications. A low-cost GPS-position tracking and data logger was developed. The evaluation was done by leaving the developed data logger unit stationary in three different circumstance condition; Open field; Under tree canopy and Near building. The result show that the position recorded had standard deviation of precision of 0.57, 0.85 and 2.22 m in longitude-axis and 0.29, 0.64 and 0.91 m in latitude-axis for Open field; Under tree canopy and Near building respectively. The next state of the research is to evaluate the accuracy of the developed GPS-data logger in dynamics operation together with the performance comparison with the commercial GPS data logger. The result shows that the precision level of 0.5 m is still needed to be developed. Otherwise, the integrated sensor technique must be implied.",
