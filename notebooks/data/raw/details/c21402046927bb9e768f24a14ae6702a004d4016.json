  "abstract": "IoT covers several application domains, each of them with different features, requirements and constraints. Precision agriculture is one of such domains, having very specific and rigid requirements, including typically a WSN, M2M communications and interaction with computational platforms available through the Internet. Despite its popularity, IP-based communication stacks are not suitable for many of these kind of applications, mainly because of the overhead associated. In this paper we propose a new M2M Communication Stack, designed to fit the Sheep IT project requirements, but developed with more generic applications in the area of intelligent farming in mind. Along with the stack definition, this paper also includes experimental results showing the feasibility of the proposed stack.",
