  "abstract": "Under the guidance of modern precision agriculture management, the author followed the agronomic requirements of field operation and selected the experimental field to collect and test the agricultural field information with the quick test technique. It is concluded that the experimental field is alkaline soil, the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium distributed unevenly in the soil, the organic matter contents in small amount, the trace element is in low effectiveness. Furthermore, the author discusses the improved method and provides the data support for the local agricultural operation, which can thus reduce the information collection period and cost of the field equipment.",
