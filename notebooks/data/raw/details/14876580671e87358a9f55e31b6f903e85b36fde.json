  "abstract": "For achieving accurate detection of greenhouse planting environment and obtaining agricultural information such as illumination and air conditions, a multi-node greenhouse environment information collection system was designed combining environment information integrated sensor fusion technology and Internet of Thing technology. The experimental results show that the system is stable in operation, and the collected environmental information data has high precision, which can better detect greenhouse plantations and provide reliable environmental information data.",
