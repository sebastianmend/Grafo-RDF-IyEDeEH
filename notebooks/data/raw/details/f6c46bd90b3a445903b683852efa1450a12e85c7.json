  "abstract": "This work presents the application of precision agriculture based on cyber physical systems (PACPS). We implemented and tested the essential components of PACPS, namely, moisture sensing, actuating a solenoid valve based on a lower threshold value of sensor data as well and generation of actuation signals. Further, we have also implemented, transmission of data to a remote server. We have observed that PACPS is more efficient compared to traditional agricultural practices in terms of physical labour and the total cost. Our laboratory experimentation and subsequent observations also reveal that the system ensures consistent nourishment to the roots of the crops and therefore reduces soil erosion compared to traditional methods.",
