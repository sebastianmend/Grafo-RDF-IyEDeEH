  "abstract": "The paper presents the design and development of a hyperspectral data acquisition system which provides high precision measurements for vegetation reflectance. The system was developed using four spectrometers, two of them for the visible domain and two for near-infrared. They measure the incident radiation and the reflected one simultaneously. In order to establish the optimal value of the integration time, an iterative algorithm was used for each spectrometer. A software platform was developed on the Raspberry Pi microcontroller system for data acquisition, data processing and remote control. The system provides real-time data processing and graphical representation of the acquired data.",
