  "abstract": "A wireless sensor network (WSN) has become an important technology and has been deployed in many emerging applications, including home automation, health care, and precision agriculture. To deploy more service applications, the WSN must solve the internetworking problem (difference in speed, protocol stack, beacon collision etc.). In this study, we propose a redundant-path scheme based on a multichannel WSN for an efficient interworking among the heterogeneous networks. We evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme through a real-world simulation, and the results show an improvement in data throughput, packet delay, and beacon loss ratio.",
