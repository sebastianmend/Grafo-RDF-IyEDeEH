  "abstract": "Satellite imagery is used in various application such as metrological, change detection, disaster migration, agriculture development etc. With the changing habits of the agriculture practice, there is a need to estimate the vegetated area with the non-vegetated area for the yield estimation. Therefore an approach has been critically evaluated for precision agriculture monitoring especially for area estimation using satellite data with the efficient application of image processing tools. For this purpose sentinel-2 and drone data is used.",
