  "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has the means to shape the future of many industries. Data is the language of the communication between different nodes through the network; the networks are the communication channel. The cloud is the home and destination of the data which adds intelligence through data analytics software, Precision agriculture uses the IoT features to help in managing crops production, by optimizing the quality of the crops through applying required nutrients and reduce the harmful impacts on the environment due to the application of excess pesticides. In this paper, we deployed a sensing network to gather the field data of some crops (Potatoes, Tomatoes, etc.), then fed these data to a machine learning algorithm to get a warning message finally displaying both the data and the warning message through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).",
