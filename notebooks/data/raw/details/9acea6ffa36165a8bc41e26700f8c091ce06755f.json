  "abstract": "Oil - palm plantation is a crucial determinant for land-use planning and agricultural studies . Remote sensing techniques have elevated limitations of the on - site survey as computerized imaging is much efficient and economical. This paper presents a ubiquitous application of Gabor analysis for extracting oil - palm plantation from satellite images . The proposed system was built on the cloud-based Google Earth Engine . Herein, THEOS images were convoluted with Gabor kernels, and both K-Means and SVM then learned their responses for comparison. Experimental results showed that SVM could better identify the plantation areas with precision, recall, and accuracy of 92.98 % , 88 . 96 % , and 94 . 24 % respectively.",
