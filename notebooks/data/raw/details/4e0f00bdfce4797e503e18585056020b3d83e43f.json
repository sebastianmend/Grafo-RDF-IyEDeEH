  "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has become a powerful remote sensing tool during the last 25 years. Most relevant products are three dimensional and projected on a cartographic system: topographic, thematic and change-detection maps. Starting with the requirements of precision agriculture, subsurface tomography, subsidence and cartography a low weight drone-borne SAR was designed. It operates in P, L and C-bands with cross-track (InSAR) and differential Interferometry (DInSAR). The requirements of the foreseen applications, concept, design, results and validation from regular surveys and ground truths are presented.",
