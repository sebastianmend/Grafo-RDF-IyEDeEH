311e8edb636278d4b8c8d03010b56cc53f8b2a05,New evaluation method to detect physiological stress in fruit trees by airborne hyperspectral image spectroscopy,"Nowadays airborne remote sensing data are increasingly used in precision agriculture. The fast space-time dependent localization of stresses in orchards, which allows for a more efficient application of horticultural technologies, could lead to improved sustainable precise management. The disadvantage of the near field multi and hyper spectroscopy is the spot sample taking, which can apply independently only for experimental survey in plantations. The traditional satellite images is optionally suitable for precision investigation because of the low spectral and ground resolution on field condition. The presented airborne hyperspectral image spectroscopy reduces above mentioned disadvantages and at the same time provides newer analyzing possibility to the user. In this paper we demonstrate the conditions of data base collection and some informative examination possibility. The estimating of the board band vegetation indices calculated from reflectance is well known in practice of the biomass stress examinations. In this method the N-dimension spectral data cube enables to calculate numerous special narrow band indexes and to evaluate maps. This paper aims at investigating the applied hyperspectral analysis for fruit tree stress detection. In our study, hyperspectral data were collected by an AISA DUAL hyperspectral image spectroscopy system, with high (0,5-1,5 m) ground resolution. The research focused on determining of leaves condition in different fruit plantations in the peach orchard near Siófok. Moreover the spectral reflectance analyses could provide more information about plant condition due to changes in the absorption of incident light in the visible and near infrared range of the spectrum.

21a8aaceb8984952950f3ebdd4bfd445813419c8,Application of Vegetation Indices for Agricultural Crop Yield Prediction Using Neural Network Techniques,"Spatial variability in a crop field creates a need for precision agriculture. Economical and rapid means of identifying spatial variability is obtained through the use of geotechnology (remotely sensed images of the crop field, image processing, GIS modeling approach, and GPS usage) and data mining techniques for model development. Higher-end image processing techniques are followed to establish more precision. The goal of this paper was to investigate the strength of key spectral vegetation indices for agricultural crop yield prediction using neural network techniques. Four widely used spectral indices were investigated in a study of irrigated corn crop yields in the Oakes Irrigation Test Area research site of North Dakota, USA. These indices were: (a) red and near-infrared (NIR) based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), (b) green and NIR based green vegetation index (GVI), (c) red and NIR based soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and (d) red and NIR based perpendicular vegetation index (PVI). These four indices were investigated for corn yield during 3 years (1998, 1999, and 2001) and for the pooled data of these 3 years. Initially, Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) models were developed, including 16 models (4 indices * 4 years including the data from the pooled years) to test for the efficiency determination of those four vegetation indices in corn crop yield prediction. The corn yield was best predicted using BPNN models that used the means and standard deviations of PVI grid images. In all three years, it provided higher prediction accuracies, coefficient of determination (r2), and lower standard error of prediction than the models involving GVI, NDVI, and SAVI image information. The GVI, NDVI, and SAVI models for all three years provided average testing prediction accuracies of 24.26% to 94.85%, 19.36% to 95.04%, and 19.24% to 95.04%, respectively while the PVI models for all three years provided average testing prediction accuracies of 83.50% to 96.04%. The PVI pool model provided better average testing prediction accuracy of 94% with respect to other vegetation models, for which it ranged from 89–93%. Similarly, the PVI pool model provided coefficient of determination (r2) value of 0.45 as compared to 0.31–0.37 for other index models. Log10 data transformation technique was used to enhance the prediction ability of the PVI models of years 1998, 1999, and 2001 as it was chosen as the preferred index. Another model (Transformed PVI (Pool)) was developed using the log10 transformed PVI image information to show its global application. The transformed PVI models provided average corn yield prediction accuracies of 90%, 97%, and 98% for years 1998, 1999, and 2001, respectively. The pool PVI transformed model provided as average testing accuracy of 93% along with r2 value of 0.72 and standard error of prediction of 0.05 t/ha.",2010,365,11,10.3390/rs2030673,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21a8aaceb8984952950f3ebdd4bfd445813419c8,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

cf34ba2beb033fb2f525c6be10852042c164b239,Effect of Subsurface Drip System in Nitrate Leaching,"Fertigation enables the application of soluble fertilizers and other chemicals along with irrigation water, uniformly and more efficiently. Improved water efficiency under drip irrigation, by reducing percolation and evaporation losses, provides for environmentally safer fertilizer application through the irrigation water. The overall problem is to identify economically viable practices that offer a significant reduction of NO3-N losses through leaching, which also fit in the farming systems practiced under a particular soil type and set of climate conditions. An experiment was conducted at Precision Farming Development Centre, Water Technology Centre, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi to study the leaching of nitrate from the root zone of potato under surface and subsurface drip irrigation system. The study consisted of 2 types of drip system (surface and surface drip) as main treatments and 3 levels of irrigation including 100% crop evapotranspiration, 80% of crop evapotranspiration and 60 % of crop evapotranspiration as sub-treatments. Direct correlation was found between the amount of irrigation water and nitrate leaching. Reduction of amount of irrigation water to the tune of 40% decreased the nitrate leaching from 30% to 10 per cent. It was observed that by changing the position of water source from surface to subsurface, the nitrate leaching decreased by 12-20%, and thus subsurface drip (10 cm depth of drip tape) was recommended in potato crop to get higher yield with minimum leaching of soil nitrate-nitrogen.",2010,1,0,10.52151/jae2010471.1401,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf34ba2beb033fb2f525c6be10852042c164b239,JournalArticle,Journal of Agricultural Engineering

Growers in the region are eager to adopt modern technology to improve productivity and income. Use of information derived from remote sensing satellites to better manage farms and rangelands while reducing environmental impacts has gained popularity in recent years. However, prohibitive costs and non-availability of near real time remote sensing imagery has slowed the adoption of this technology for in-field decision making. Digital Northern Great Plains (DNGP), a web based remote sensing data dissemination system, was developed to address these drawbacks. It provides end users easy and free access to a variety of imagery and products in near real time. With delivery of archived and current data, DNGP has helped farmers and ranchers reduce operational costs and increase productivity through a variety of innovative applications.

A simple model that simulates virtual fields is developed to evaluate these algorithms. Virtual fields are made of crops, arranged according to agricultural practices and represented by simple patterns, and weeds that are spatially distributed using a statistical approach. It ensures a user-defined Weed Infestation Rate (WIR). Then, experimental devices using cameras are simulated with a pinhole model.

a3408d2ec113c88aba76b4f70657c22aee47891e,Design and First Results of an UAV-Borne L-Band Radiometer for Multiple Monitoring Purposes,"UAV (unmanned Aerial Vehicle) platforms represent a challenging opportunity for the deployment of a number of remote sensors. These vehicles are a cost-effective option in front of manned aerial vehicles (planes and helicopters), are easy to deploy due to the short runways needed, and they allow users to meet the critical requirements of the spatial and temporal resolutions imposed by the instruments. L-band radiometers are an interesting option for obtaining soil moisture maps over local areas with relatively high spatial resolution for precision agriculture, coastal monitoring, estimation of the risk of fires, flood prevention, etc. This paper presents the design of a light-weight, airborne L-band radiometer for deployment in a small UAV, including the hardware and specific software developed for calibration, geo-referencing, and soil moisture retrieval.

5ad3993b2b56f10931e55bd2394931204e568b44,Survey examines the adoption of perceived best management practices for almond nutrition.,"Fertilizer use in California agriculture has been under recent scrutiny regarding its impacts on air, surface water and groundwater quality. In June 2007, we surveyed almond growers to assess their plant nutrition practices, identify opportunities for improvement, and target research and extension needs. The majority of respondents, particularly those with large almond acreages, used fertigation to apply nitrogen; applied nitrogen coincident with periods of maximal plant demand; and collected annual tissue samples for analysis. While the survey results suggested broad compliance with the best-available management practices and are likely to indicate good nutrient-use efficiency, they also suggested that growers are uncertain about current practices to monitor orchard nutrient status and would value additional information to enable greater precision in fertilization rates and timing.",2010,26,0,10.3733/CA.V064N03P149,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ad3993b2b56f10931e55bd2394931204e568b44,Review,

Using these established technologies, the farming community has successfully increased the yield and efficiency of production in most agricultural species while utilizing land resources that are often unsuitable for other agricultural purposes. Moving forward, animal well-being and agricultural sustainability are moral and economic priorities of consumers and producers alike. Therefore, these considerations will be included in any strategy designed to meet the challenges produced by global climate change and an expanding world population. Improvements in the efficiency and precision of genetic technologies will enable a timely response to meet the multifaceted food requirements of a rapidly increasing world population.",2010,58,2,10.2527/jas.2010-2847,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8752c484834395b408157260ceb68973de11591,JournalArticle,Journal of Animal Science

d874fa8ad1f95a036ba6c27dd4aa872951a6963d,Remote Sensing and Geospatial Technological Applications for Site-specific Management of Fruit and Nut Crops: A Review,"Site-specific crop management (SSCM) is one facet of precision agriculture which is helping increase production with minimal input. It has enhanced the cost-benefit scenario in crop production. Even though the SSCM is very widely used in row crop agriculture like corn, wheat, rice, soybean, etc. it has very little application in cash crops like fruit and nut. The main goal of this review paper was to conduct a comprehensive review of advanced technologies, including geospatial technologies, used in site-specific management of fruit and nut crops. The review explores various remote sensing data from different platforms like satellite, LIDAR, aerial, and field imaging. The study analyzes the use of satellite sensors, such as Quickbird, Landsat, SPOT, and IRS imagery as well as hyperspectral narrow-band remote sensing data in study of fruit and nut crops in blueberry, citrus, peach, apple, etc. The study also explores other geospatial technologies such as GPS, GIS spatial modeling, advanced image processing techniques, and information technology for suitability study, orchard delineation, and classification accuracy assessment. The study also provides an example of a geospatial model developed in ArcGIS ModelBuilder to automate the blueberry production suitability analysis. The GIS spatial model is developed using various crop characteristics such as chilling hours, soil permeability, drainage, and pH, and land cover to determine the best sites for growing blueberry in Georgia, U.S. The study also provides a list of spectral reflectance curves developed for some fruit and nut crops, blueberry, crowberry, redblush citrus, orange, prickly pear, and peach. The study also explains these curves in detail to help researchers choose the image platform, sensor, and spectrum wavelength for various fruit and nut crops SSCM.",2010,64,2,10.3390/rs2081973,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d874fa8ad1f95a036ba6c27dd4aa872951a6963d,"JournalArticle,Review",Remote Sensing

9faa39010bd3fd7076cf638aad03a7e6704e0d57,FPGA-based Fused Smart Sensor for Real-Time Plant-Transpiration Dynamic Estimation,"Plant transpiration is considered one of the most important physiological functions because it constitutes the plants evolving adaptation to exchange moisture with a dry atmosphere which can dehydrate or eventually kill the plant. Due to the importance of transpiration, accurate measurement methods are required; therefore, a smart sensor that fuses five primary sensors is proposed which can measure air temperature, leaf temperature, air relative humidity, plant out relative humidity and ambient light. A field programmable gate array based unit is used to perform signal processing algorithms as average decimation and infinite impulse response filters to the primary sensor readings in order to reduce the signal noise and improve its quality. Once the primary sensor readings are filtered, transpiration dynamics such as: transpiration, stomatal conductance, leaf-air-temperature-difference and vapor pressure deficit are calculated in real time by the smart sensor. This permits the user to observe different primary and calculated measurements at the same time and the relationship between these which is very useful in precision agriculture in the detection of abnormal conditions. Finally, transpiration related stress conditions can be detected in real time because of the use of online processing and embedded communications capabilities.",2010,28,0,10.3390/s100908316,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9faa39010bd3fd7076cf638aad03a7e6704e0d57,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

Therefore, it is apparent that optimal energy management is one of the most important challenges in WSN development. However, energy management requires in-depth knowledge and detailed insight concerning specific scenarios. After Carrying out a large number of experiments in precision agriculture, we find that it is the sensors that have never been concerned consuming the most energy of the node. In order to conserve energy and prolong the lifetime of WSN, we design and carry out a dynamic energy management strategy for sensors. The basic idea is to shut down all sensors’ power when not needed and wake them up when necessary.

The garden is a mesh network of robots and plants. The gardening robots are mobile manipulators with an eye-in-hand camera. They are capable of locating plants in the garden, watering them, and locating and grasping fruit. The plants are potted cherry tomatoes enhanced with sensors and computation to monitor their well-being (e.g. soil humidity, state of fruits) and with networking to communicate servicing requests to the robots. By embedding sensing, computation, and communication into the pots, task allocation in the system is de-centrally coordinated, which makes the system scalable and robust against the failure of a centralized agent. We describe the architecture of this system and present experimental results for navigation, object recognition, and manipulation as well as challenges that lie ahead toward autonomous precision agriculture with multi-robot teams.",2010,27,1,10.1007/s11370-010-0076-1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e8893335b006e14e23108ebe59d445190a7ffbd,JournalArticle,Intell.

5cc754acb9f4439cd7fad590b0021ae49178107b,Design of a Horizontal Penetrometer for Measuring On-the-Go Soil Resistance,"Soil compaction is one of the main negative factors that limits plant growth and crop yield. Therefore, it is important to determine the soil resistance level and map it for the field to find solutions for the negative effects of the compaction. Nowadays, high powered communication technology and computers help us on this issue within the approach of precision agriculture applications. This study is focused on the design of a penetrometer, which can make instantaneous soil resistance measurements in the soil horizontally and data acquisition software based on the GPS (Global Positioning System). The penetrometer was designed using commercial 3D parametric solid modelling design software. The data acquisition software was developed in Microsoft Visual Basic.NET programming language. After the design of the system, manufacturing and assembly of the system was completed and then a field experiment was carried out. According to the data from GPS and penetration resistance values which are collected in Microsoft SQL Server database, a Kriging method by ArcGIS was used and soil resistance was mapped in the field for a soil depth of 40 cm. During operation, no faults, either in mechanical and software parts, were seen. As a result, soil resistance values of 0.2 MPa and 3 MPa were obtained as minimum and maximum values, respectively. In conclusion, the experimental results showed that the designed system works quite well in the field and the horizontal penetrometer is a practical tool for providing on-line soil resistance measurements. This study contributes to further research for the development of on-line soil resistance measurements and mapping within the precision agriculture applications.",2010,34,3,10.3390/s101009337,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5cc754acb9f4439cd7fad590b0021ae49178107b,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

6abfe4c6cc25244f7d2df5c8247ddcf61d9fe05b,Performance Evaluation of an Infrared Thermocouple,"The measurement of the leaf temperature of forests or agricultural plants is an important technique for the monitoring of the physiological state of crops. The infrared thermometer is a convenient device due to its fast response and nondestructive measurement technique. Nowadays, a novel infrared thermocouple, developed with the same measurement principle of the infrared thermometer but using a different detector, has been commercialized for non-contact temperature measurement. The performances of two-kinds of infrared thermocouples were evaluated in this study. The standard temperature was maintained by a temperature calibrator and a special black cavity device. The results indicated that both types of infrared thermocouples had good precision. The error distribution ranged from −1.8 °C to 18 °C as the reading values served as the true values. Within the range from 13 °C to 37 °C, the adequate calibration equations were the high-order polynomial equations. Within the narrower range from 20 °C to 35 °C, the adequate equation was a linear equation for one sensor and a two-order polynomial equation for the other sensor. The accuracy of the two kinds of infrared thermocouple was improved by nearly 0.4 °C with the calibration equations. These devices could serve as mobile monitoring tools for in situ and real time routine estimation of leaf temperatures.",2010,5,0,10.3390/s101110081,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6abfe4c6cc25244f7d2df5c8247ddcf61d9fe05b,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

015bf5433166c643e3d51e41f929bbd4f2164aec,Engineering the Future with Cell Biology,"In the next 50 years, we will have to face the issue of dwindling natural resources. Our welfare is dependent on an increasing consumption of fossil materials and metals that are limited in supply. The challenge is how we can come up with solutions that enable us to live in peace and prosperity on this planet. 
 
 
 
Kai Simons 
 
 
 
This challenge can only be met with new technologies. Our present technologies are simply too energy-intensive and consume too much of the reserves that will be limited in supply in the future. The only way out is to continue miniaturization—to move into the age of nanotechnology. This implies a technological revolution with enormous challenges. It is my contention that this revolution will be fed by new cell biology. 
 
This is because all living organisms on this planet contain small machines—nanomachines—that sustain the life of each living species. Life is dependent on nanotechnology. The scaling of life is in the nanometer range. The machines in cells can produce energy and materials of almost any kind. The cellular production plants have inbuilt waste disposal systems with highly efficient recycling capabilities. The products produced in our cellular factories can be transported to their intracellular and extracellular destinations along cables by motors with unheard of performance. The cellular signaling and communication systems are wonders of precision and efficiency. Today, we are focusing cell biological research on a limited number of model organisms. The time has come to expand this repertoire to more and more organisms. Each of them will have some remarkable feature, which will provide a never-ending source of discoveries of how nature works. This will of course require a new symbiosis of engineering, physics, chemistry, and biology that has already started. 
 
Cell biology needs to introduce the strategies of engineering to unravel the design principles underlying different molecular processes. Design principles offer a potentially powerful tool to understand the rationale behind the existence of the different large families of proteins such as motor proteins—each family member may be adapted for a particular cellular or developmental role, but one really would need to unravel the design principles to substantiate this argument. You might call this strategy systems biology or synthetic biology, but in the end we want to understand the workings of life. 
 
Biotechnology today is being applied in the pharmaceutical, health, and agricultural arenas that will continue to be pillars of the biotechnological industry. However, the most important pillar for the future will be molecular bioengineering, based on nature's nanomachines. In this regard, the unending discussions on the pros and cons of genetically modified organisms, stem cells, and cloning are missing the point. The real challenge lies elsewhere, in inventing new technologies that can replace those that we use today. We do not have much time. If we cannot find alternative ways to produce energy and materials before our fossil resources start to dwindle, this planet will be threatened by wars as destructive as those in the past century. 
 
This coming revolution is not only an enormous global challenge but also full of opportunities. I predict that engineers, who today lack training or knowledge of cell biology, will in the future take their inspiration from all the wonder machines that nature has produced. Molecular cell biologists are continuously unraveling the workings of the cellular nanomachineries. This will be a real source of future welfare and wealth globally, and not like the virtual dividends that result from manipulating the financial markets.",2010,3,0,10.1091/mbc.E10-04-0344,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/015bf5433166c643e3d51e41f929bbd4f2164aec,JournalArticle,Molecular Biology of the Cell

Development of automation technology for agricultural machinery includes many aspects. As the degree of automation increases, the complexity of automation would rise. The paper focuses on the sensor sub-system, and more specifically, computer vision technology. The emergence of widely available vision technologies has enabled the manufacturers to automate a wide range of tasks. Weed control and auto-guidance systems are two areas in agriculture that have driven the development of vision technology. Applying computer vision technology makes it possible to automate the navigation tasks when the vehicle is driven along crops and other field structures. The operator stress level can be generally reduced and high precision steering in sensitive crops can be maintained through out the day. The driver can concentrate on optimizing the machine settings and ensure a safe operation of the system. Machine settings can be optimised yielding a higher quality in the field operations. The working speed can be increased, thus saving time and money.",2010,5,0,10.52151/jae2010474.1423,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/24682465bd6eb9e54e97ed2eadc65839017e8537,JournalArticle,Journal of Agricultural Engineering

Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in multivalent tetraploids is challenged by their unique cytogenetic properties, such as double reduction. We develop a statistical method for mapping multivalent tetraploid QTLs by considering these cytogenetic properties. This method is built in the mixture model-based framework and implemented with the EM algorithm. The method allows the simultaneous estimation of QTL positions, QTL effects, the chromosomal pairing factor, and the degree of double reduction as well as the assessment of the estimation precision of these parameters. We used simulated data to examine the statistical properties of the method and validate its utilization. The new method and its software will provide a useful tool for QTL mapping in multivalent tetraploids that undergo double reduction.",2011,17,2,10.1155/2010/216547,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3c52a630538c1b0a48a7dd19c004c42c9cbf26c7,JournalArticle,International Journal of Plant Genomics

036290f2fb7a48aa687be577a757488d5109c474,Variable Rate Herbicide Application Using GPS and Generating a Digital Management Map,"This chapter covers developing a precision method of variable rate application (VRA) for application of cyanazine pre-emergence herbicide which eventuates to save considerable pre-emergence herbicide, reduces its adverse effects on the environment and agricultural products, and increases crop yield. For this purpose a digital management map is generated using the global positioning system (GPS). A field of about 6500 m2 is selected for the grid soil sampling. After that local and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of the field are determined using total station surveying equipments and four static GPS receivers. Data processing is then accomplished using a personal computer equipped with surveying software. Some soil characteristics such as soil texture and soil organic matter content are also determined by soil sampling and analyzing the soil samples. Five interpolation methods are then used to determine the make-up at other points of the grid. By using Cross Validation method for evaluation of these interpolators and considering manufacture recommendations for cyanazine herbicide application based on soil texture and soil organic matter content, management zones with different herbicide application rates are determined and eventually a digital management map is generated. For implementation of the generated digital management map, a direct injection system is designed and constructed. This system is based on GPS data for positioning of sprayer, comparing the GPS data with digital management map data, measuring of speed, and finally injection of active ingredient inside carrier fluid using solenoid injectors proportionate to any management zone on the digital management map. Using the generated digital management map and equipments of VRA, optimized rate of required herbicide for the selected field is determined. Finally, total required herbicide with VRA is compared with uniform rate application for the entire selected field.",2011,4,0,10.5772/13201,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/036290f2fb7a48aa687be577a757488d5109c474,Review,

63ec3bd7a316868f729e3000f9b9ddef759a14a5,Developing a New Wireless Sensor Network Platform and Its Application in Precision Agriculture,"Wireless sensor networks are gaining greater attention from the research community and industrial professionals because these small pieces of “smart dust” offer great advantages due to their small size, low power consumption, easy integration and support for “green” applications. Green applications are considered a hot topic in intelligent environments, ubiquitous and pervasive computing. This work evaluates a new wireless sensor network platform and its application in precision agriculture, including its embedded operating system and its routing algorithm. To validate the technological platform and the embedded operating system, two different routing strategies were compared: hierarchical and flat. Both of these routing algorithms were tested in a small-scale network applied to a watermelon field. However, we strongly believe that this technological platform can be also applied to precision agriculture because it incorporates a modified version of LORA-CBF, a wireless location-based routing algorithm that uses cluster-based flooding. Cluster-based flooding addresses the scalability concerns of wireless sensor networks, while the modified LORA-CBF routing algorithm includes a metric to monitor residual battery energy. Furthermore, results show that the modified version of LORA-CBF functions well with both the flat and hierarchical algorithms, although it functions better with the flat algorithm in a small-scale agricultural network.",2011,48,2,10.3390/s110101192,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63ec3bd7a316868f729e3000f9b9ddef759a14a5,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

c39ea10b11821618381ae1007efa6a6561dd3b98,Ground water estimation and water table detection with ground penetrating radar,"A shallow subsurface survey was conducted along a 20 m long profile on a test site with the aim of mapping and assessing ground water resource of the area. The profile was scanned with ground penetrating radar using common offset geometric configuration. Velocity information obtained from the processed radar image were used to estimate and mapped the spatial distribution of the ground water within the shallow depth based on Topp’s empirical relation between the water content and the dielectric constant of the soil medium. Due to the absence of scattering objects within the deeper high water content region, borehole log data were used to correlate the radar reflection signatures with the observed stratigraphic sequences. Layer picking was used to delineate the water table which correlates well with the log data. Significant lateral variation in both the shallow water content and the level of water table were observed with the water table found to be within a depth range of 0.5 to 1.4 m. These were attributed to the nature of the soil identified as till with variable grain size distribution. The soil is therefore, considered to have great variation in hydraulic conductivity which implies significant variability in water retention capacity. Region of maximum water content within the shallow level was found to coincide with the region of higher level of the water table. The study therefore, appraised the effectiveness of GPR as a tool for precision agricultural practice and environmental studies.",2011,9,0,10.3923/AJES.2011.193.202,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c39ea10b11821618381ae1007efa6a6561dd3b98,Review,

c9dd524ef59f0131ca0fee1d02b0f3d5733c9f0d,The pH of Australian soils: field results from a national survey,"The pH is one of the fundamental soil properties governing nutrient availability, metal mobility, elemental toxicity, microbial activity, and plant growth. The field pH of topsoil (0–0.10 m depth) and subsoil (~0.60–0.80 m depth) was measured on floodplain soils collected near the outlet of 1186 catchments covering >6 Mkm2 (6 × 1012 m2) or ~80% of Australia. Field pH duplicate data, obtained at 124 randomly selected sites, indicate a precision of 0.5 pH unit (or 7%), and mapped pH patterns are consistent and meaningful. The median topsoil pH is 6.5, while the subsoil pH has a median of 7 but is strongly bimodal (6–6.5 and 8–8.5). In most cases (64%) the topsoil and subsoil pH values are similar; among the sites exhibiting a pH contrast, those with more acidic topsoils are more common (28%) than those with more alkaline topsoils (7%). The distribution of soil pH at the national scale indicates the strong controls exerted by precipitation and ensuing leaching (e.g. low pH along the coastal fringe, high pH in the dry centre), aridity (e.g. high pH where calcrete is common in the regolith), vegetation (e.g. low pH reflecting abundant soil organic matter), and subsurface lithology (e.g. high pH over limestone bedrock).

8b4f73c5ab99b4f3d4bc46557a5c8365ac39cc3d,Diagnosis of nutrient imbalances with vector analysis in agroforestry systems.,"Agricultural intensification has had unintended environmental consequences, including increased nutrient leaching and surface runoff and other agrarian-derived pollutants. Improved diagnosis of on-farm nutrient dynamics will have the advantage of increasing yields and will diminish financial and environmental costs. To achieve this, a management support system that allows for site-specific rapid evaluation of nutrient production imbalances and subsequent management prescriptions is needed for agroecological design. Vector diagnosis, a bivariate model to depict changes in yield and nutritional response simultaneously in a single graph, facilitates identification of nutritional status such as growth dilution, deficiency, sufficiency, luxury uptake, and toxicity. Quantitative data from cocoa agroforestry systems and pigeonpea intercropping trials in Ghana and Tanzania, respectively, were re-evaluated with vector analysis. Relative to monoculture, biomass increase in cocoa ( L.) under shade (35-80%) was accompanied by a 17 to 25% decline in P concentration, the most limiting nutrient on this site. Similarly, increasing biomass with declining P concentrations was noted for pigeonpea [ (L). Millsp.] in response to soil moisture availability under intercropping. Although vector analysis depicted nutrient responses, the current vector model does not consider non-nutrient resource effects on growth, such as ameliorated light and soil moisture, which were particularly active in these systems. We revisit and develop vector analysis into a framework for diagnosing nutrient and non-nutrient interactions in agroforestry systems. Such a diagnostic technique advances management decision-making by increasing nutrient precision and reducing environmental issues associated with agrarian-derived soil contamination.",2011,45,2,10.2134/jeq2010.0144,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b4f73c5ab99b4f3d4bc46557a5c8365ac39cc3d,JournalArticle,Journal of Environmental Quality
9e94b3dc8002f9752ceedd4f90aeee0d300fdc55,Biomolecular Detection employing the Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor (IRIS),"The sensitive measurement of biomolecular interactions has use in many fields and industries such as basic biology and microbiology, environmental/agricultural/biodefense monitoring, nanobiotechnology, and more. For diagnostic applications, monitoring (detecting) the presence, absence, or abnormal expression of targeted proteomic or genomic biomarkers found in patient samples can be used to determine treatment approaches or therapy efficacy. In the research arena, information on molecular affinities and specificities are useful for fully characterizing the systems under investigation. Many of the current systems employed to determine molecular concentrations or affinities rely on the use of labels. Examples of these systems include immunoassays such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, gel electrophoresis assays, and mass spectrometry (MS). Generally, these labels are fluorescent, radiological, or colorimetric in nature and are directly or indirectly attached to the molecular target of interest. Though the use of labels is widely accepted and has some benefits, there are drawbacks which are stimulating the development of new label-free methods for measuring these interactions. These drawbacks include practical facets such as increased assay cost, reagent lifespan and usability, storage and safety concerns, wasted time and effort in labelling, and variability among the different reagents due to the labelling processes or labels themselves. On a scientific research basis, the use of these labels can also introduce difficulties such as concerns with effects on protein functionality/structure due to the presence of the attached labels and the inability to directly measure the interactions in real time. Presented here is the use of a new label-free optical biosensor that is amenable to microarray studies, termed the Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor (IRIS), for detecting proteins, DNA, antigenic material, whole pathogens (virions) and other biological material. The IRIS system has been demonstrated to have high sensitivity, precision, and reproducibility for different biomolecular interactions [1-3]. Benefits include multiplex imaging capacity, real time and endpoint measurement capabilities, and other high-throughput attributes such as reduced reagent consumption and a reduction in assay times. Additionally, the IRIS platform is simple to use, requires inexpensive equipment, and utilizes silicon-based solid phase assay components making it compatible with many contemporary surface chemistry approaches. Here, we present the use of the IRIS system from preparation of probe arrays to incubation and measurement of target binding to analysis of the results in an endpoint format. The model system will be the capture of target antibodies which are specific for human serum albumin (HSA) on HSA-spotted substrates.",2011,2,0,10.3791/2694,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9e94b3dc8002f9752ceedd4f90aeee0d300fdc55,JournalArticle,Journal of Visualized Experiments

Using this measurement system, trees were scanned from two opposing sides to obtain two three-dimensional point clouds. After registration of the point clouds, a simple and easily obtainable parameter is the number of impacts received by the scanned vegetation. The work in this study is based on the hypothesis of the existence of a linear relationship between the number of impacts of the LIDAR sensor laser beam on the vegetation and the tree leaf area. Tests performed under laboratory conditions using an ornamental tree and, subsequently, in a pear tree orchard demonstrate the correct operation of the measurement system presented in this paper. The results from both the laboratory and field tests confirm the initial hypothesis and the 3D Dynamic Measurement System is validated in field operation. This opens the door to new lines of research centred on the geometric characterization of tree crops in the field of agriculture and, more specifically, in precision fruit growing.",2011,106,2,10.3390/s110605769,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72918abdbce24a703c55ceb434331266daedbd16,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

The use of sensors helps exploit all available resources appropriately and to apply hazardous products moderately. When nutrients in the soil, humidity, solar radiation, density of weeds and a broad set of factors and data affecting the production are known, this situation improves and the use of chemical products such as fertilizers, herbicides and other pollutants can be reduced considerably. Part of this knowledge allows also monitoring photosynthetic parameters of high relevance for photosynthesis. Most of the associated activities fall within the scope of what it is called Precision Agriculture, an emerging area receiving special attention in recent years.

96aad6748db194cbe272d77dcb0fdf4e0b7deb6e,A Programmable Plug & Play Sensor Interface for WSN Applications,"Cost reduction in wireless sensor networks (WSN) becomes a priority when extending their application to fields where a great number of sensors is needed, such as habitat monitoring, precision agriculture or diffuse greenhouse emission measurement. In these cases, the use of smart sensors is expensive, consequently requiring the use of low-cost sensors. The solution to convert such generic low-cost sensors into intelligent ones leads to the implementation of a versatile system with enhanced processing and storage capabilities to attain a plug and play electronic interface able to adapt to all the sensors used. This paper focuses on this issue and presents a low-voltage plug & play reprogrammable interface capable of adapting to different sensor types and achieving an optimum reading performance for every sensor. The proposed interface, which includes both electronic and software elements so that it can be easily integrated in WSN nodes, is described and experimental test results to validate its performance are given.",2011,4,0,10.3390/s110909009,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96aad6748db194cbe272d77dcb0fdf4e0b7deb6e,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors
b1aba7d3e3c1a82bf972c6a8e2a6d4f9eb6f5c58,Functional Mapping of Dynamic Traits with Robust t-Distribution,"Functional mapping has been a powerful tool in mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying dynamic traits of agricultural or biomedical interest. In functional mapping, multivariate normality is often assumed for the underlying data distribution, partially due to the ease of parameter estimation. The normality assumption however could be easily violated in real applications due to various reasons such as heavy tails or extreme observations. Departure from normality has negative effect on testing power and inference for QTL identification. In this work, we relax the normality assumption and propose a robust multivariate -distribution mapping framework for QTL identification in functional mapping. Simulation studies show increased mapping power and precision with the distribution than that of a normal distribution. The utility of the method is demonstrated through a real data analysis.",2011,7,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0024902,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b1aba7d3e3c1a82bf972c6a8e2a6d4f9eb6f5c58,JournalArticle,PLoS ONE

05195e65aa10616ec9120a9510941e29449e7ac2,Detectability Counts when Assessing Populations for Biodiversity Targets,"Efficient, practical and accurate estimates of population parameters are a necessary basis for effective conservation action to meet biodiversity targets. The brown hare is representative of many European farmland species: historically widespread and abundant but having undergone rapid declines as a result of agricultural intensification. As a priority species in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, it has national targets for population increase that are part of wider national environmental indicators. Previous research has indicated that brown hare declines have been greatest in pastural landscapes and that gains might be made by focussing conservation effort there. We therefore used hares in pastural landscapes to examine how basic changes in survey methodology can affect the precision of population density estimates and related these to national targets for biodiversity conservation in the UK. Line transects for hares carried out at night resulted in higher numbers of detections, had better-fitting detection functions and provided more robust density estimates with lower effort than those during the day, due primarily to the increased probability of detection of hares at night and the nature of hare responses to the observer. Hare spring densities varied widely within a single region, with a pooled mean of 20.6 hares km−2, significantly higher than the reported national average of hares in pastures of 3.3 hares km−2. The high number of encounters allowed us to resolve hare densities at site, season and year scales. We demonstrate how survey conduct can impact on data quantity and quality with implications for setting and monitoring biodiversity targets. Our case study of the brown hare provides evidence that for wildlife species with low detectability, large scale volunteer-based monitoring programmes, either species specific or generalist, might be more successfully and efficiently carried out by a small number of trained personnel able to employ methods that maximise detectability.",2011,10,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0024206,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05195e65aa10616ec9120a9510941e29449e7ac2,"JournalArticle,Review",PLoS ONE

9bbf4a45303dd4cd36747d29ee33fa93dac15b86,Spectral Remote Sensing of the Responses of Soybean Plants to Environmental Stresses,"Precision agriculture, site-specific application of inputs tailored to the needs of the crop, is one of the new ways that modern agriculture could potentially maintain or enhance crop yields and minimize environmental pollution. Knowledge about variations in vegetation species and community distribution patterns, alterations in vegetation phenological cycles, and modifications in the plant physiology and morphology provide valuable insight into the climatic, edaphic, geologic, and geophysical characteristics of Earth’s areas (Janetos & Justice, 2000). During the past decade remote sensing techniques have been widely used to monitor crops throughout their growing period to help in making decisions for good agricultural practices. Spectral remote sensing methods provide the possibility for early, efficient, objective, and non-destructive evaluation of plant responses to different stress factors of the environment (Campbell et al., 2007; Govender et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010). Field remote sensing applications addressed agriculture and forestry survey, fire detection and fire-fuel mapping, mineral mapping, and atmospheric modelling. Airborne, space-borne and hand-held technologies are commonly used to investigate the spectral responses of plants. Hyperspectral remote sensing makes possible to enhance significantly the spectral measurement capabilities over conventional remote sensing sensor systems, as well as to improve the spectral information content. This entails detailed assessment of the changes in the physiological stage of plants in response to the changes in the environment (ZarcoTejada et al., 2002; Steele et al., 2008a), detecting of early-stage vegetation stress (Krezhova et al., 2005; Ouyang et al., 2007), discriminating land cover types (Flamenco-Sandoval et al., 2007), leaf pigment concentrations (Coops et al., 2003), modelling quantitative biophysical and yield characteristics of agricultural crops (Delalieux et al., 2009a; Chatzistathisa et al., 2011). Ground-truth is essential for detecting plant stress, and two commonly used ground-based optical methods, leaf spectral reflectance and chlorophyll fluorescence, are reviewed for their usefulness and practical application. When these methods were combined with remarkable advances in Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, geographic information systems (GIS), and enhanced crop simulation models, remote sensing technology has the potential to transform the ways that growers manage their lands and implement precision farming techniques (Upchurch, 2003; Hatfield, et al., 2008; Shuanggen & Komjathy, 2010). To obtain accurate and complementary comparative assessments for plant responses to the environmental changes, methods have been applied from different research fields remote",2011,9,0,10.5772/24741,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9bbf4a45303dd4cd36747d29ee33fa93dac15b86,Review,

This prototype system is composed of remote on-line classification platform (ROCP), which uses a digital signal processor (DSP) as a core CPU, and a host control platform (HCP). The ROCP is in charge of acquiring the pest image, extracting image features and detecting the class of pest using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier. It sends the image data, which is encoded using JPEG 2000 in DSP, to the HCP through the 3G network at the same time for further identification. The image transmission and communication are accomplished using 3G technology. Our system transmits the data via a commercial base station. The system can work properly based on the effective coverage of base stations, no matter the distance from the ROCP to the HCP. In the HCP, the image data is decoded and the pest image displayed in real-time for further identification. Authentication and performance tests of the prototype system were conducted. The authentication test showed that the image data were transmitted correctly. Based on the performance test results on six classes of pests, the average accuracy is 82%. Considering the different live pests’ pose and different field lighting conditions, the result is satisfactory. The proposed technique is well suited for implementation in field pest classification on-line for precision agriculture.",2012,10,0,10.3390/s120303118,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b73b93b643b436f35d7ddcf677dbf8851fbbf0cc,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

Several plants are used in traditional medicine against inflammatory diseases as well as various types of tumors on the base the potential of their chemical constituents. Although many compounds are extremely toxic, when we have the relation between the toxicity of a compound and its chemical pattern of substitution that can result in a more in-depth understanding of these compounds (Atta-ur-Rahman, 2005). Today, even after more than 200 years, the chemistry of natural products remains a challenge and an important field of research in several science areas (chemistry, biology, medicine, agronomy, botany and pharmacy). The reasons for it’s large use are the considerable pharmacological potential observed in natural products, in the great development in the process of detection, isolation, purification and, especially, the advances in spectrometric techniques [infrared (IR), mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR 1H and 13C) for structural elucidation of new and complex compounds. These advances were outstanding in both NMR and MS spectrometry. The NMR allows the complete 1H and 13C NMR spectral assignments (chemical shifts and coupling constants) which serve to build a data base to support computer assisted structure elucidation. These data are also useful in the fuller understanding of the correlations between molecular conformation and biological activity of natural substances with biological importance (Loganathan et al., 1990). Mass spectrometry has a huge application in chemistry, biochemistry, medicine, pharmacology, agriculture and food science. Although the mass spectrometric ionization techniques EI (electron impact) and CI (chemical ionization) required the analyte molecules to be present in the gas phase and were thus suitable only for volatile compounds, the development of several desorption ionization methods [FD (field desorption), FABMS (fast atom bombardment), ESIMS (electrospray), MALDI-MS (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization)] allowed the hight-precision mass spectrometric analysis of different classes of biomolecules.",2012,25,0,10.5772/24242,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c4a3de001b499a76a24feb0bcc6dd605cfb5617,Review,

The efforts to revive the ecological functions needs multiple scale approach, which include scientific understanding, time dependent restorative activities and incorporation of wisdom of the stakeholders. Conservation initiatives linked to precision farming is an apt mechanism to minimize the loss of natural resources of agricultural landscapes to maintain the complex stabilizers of ecological functions. Such an effort must address the scientific evaluation of the farm as “ecologically sustainable unit” with due consideration to social construct at local to regional level.

Its main product decisions are based on maps that provide the variation of soil parameters. For reliable maps there is a need to collect large amount of samples, resulting in costly implementation of the technique. The present study aimed to evaluate the sampling grids particularities designed to understand the spatial distribution of soil chemical parameters, as well as propose a methodology for evaluation of soil fertility. We tested different instruments of soil collecting, type of samples and sample preparation methodology. The study assumes that the traditional method of fertility survey analyzes several parameters quantified in the laboratory for prescribing agricultural recommendations. Its use is limited by the cost-intensive, compromising the accuracy of the application of agricultural inputs. This way the work tested a method that aims quantify soil chemical attributes with low cost and estimate parameters related to the agricultural prescription, and so, increase the number of samples with less parameters to be analyzed instead of a few samples with many parameters. The methodology presented satisfactory results for quantification of lime requirement. For most of the areas studied the effects of limestone was statistically equal to the estimated lime requirement calculated by the traditional method of soil analysis. The smallest difference presented by the methodologies and the need for liming was 0.035 Mg ha−1 and the biggest difference was 0.203 Mg ha−1.",2012,0,0,10.11606/D.11.2012.TDE-16082012-105301,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e2648465d4da35d2a25400833c91d8177b70d179,Review,

2ff58fc5b4f4d0903a1fb21176ac03d7e204adc5,Assessment of soil characteristics in orchard,"Spatial variability of soil properties may appear in yield variation within a single field even in areas considered to be homogeneous from soil survey point of view. Effects of various sources of soil heterogeneity on the annual or longterm average soil water budget appear to differ markedly (Kim, 1995). Furthermore the negative water balance in the Carpathian Lowland: 450–600 mm precipitation vs. 680–720 mm potential evapotranspiration is equilibrated by horizontal inflow (on the surface as runoff, in the unsaturated zone as seepage; and in the saturated zone as groundwater flow), which leads to the accumulation of the weathering products of the large catchment area. In addiction to the hardly predictable atmospheric precipitation pattern, the two additional reasons of extreme soil moisture regime (the simultaneous hazard of waterlogging or overmoistening and drought sensitivity) are: – the heterogeneous microrelief of the „flat” lowland; – the highly variable, sometimes mosaic-like soil cover and the unfavourable physical and hydrophysical properties of some soils (mainly due to heavy texture, high clay and swelling clay content, or high sodium saturation: ESP). The hyperand multispectral technology is widely used in the precision agriculture (Burai, 2006; Milics et al. 2008), field growing of plants, and nowadays in gardening culture (Tamás et al. 2009). Remote sensing technologies make a possibility to the time series analyzing of the gardening stock and obtaining information of qualitative and quantitative parameters of plants (Berke et al. 2004).",2012,1,0,10.31421/ijhs/18/1/986,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ff58fc5b4f4d0903a1fb21176ac03d7e204adc5,Review,

These analyses continue to be developed, for example in studies of natural populations. Genomic methods are having an impact on progress and prospects. Actual relationships of individuals can be estimated enabling novel quantitative analyses. Increasing precision of linkage mapping is feasible with dense marker panels and designed stocks allowing multiple generations of recombination, and large SNP panels enable the use of genome wide association analysis utilising historical recombination. Whilst such analyses are identifying many loci for disease genes and traits such as height, typically each individually contributes a small amount of the variation. Only by fitting all SNPs without regard to significance can a high proportion be accounted for, so a classical polygenic model with near infinitesimally small effects remains a useful one. Theory indicates that a high proportion of variants will have low minor allele frequency, making detection difficult. Genomic selection, based on simultaneously fitting very dense markers and incorporating these with phenotypic data in breeding value prediction is revolutionising breeding programmes in agriculture and has a major potential role in human disease prediction.",2012,54,8,10.2174/138920212800543110,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/38b355c82682ce0d0e62835f856144faa2fc35b9,JournalArticle,Current Genomics

8f69e420ce1ced46c518fcfd3484af1c672e7fee,The importance of grasslands for animal production and other functions: a review on management and methodological progress in the tropics.,"The global importance of grasslands is indicated by their extent; they comprise some 26% of total land area and 80% of agriculturally productive land. The majority of grasslands are located in tropical developing countries where they are particularly important to the livelihoods of some one billion poor peoples. Grasslands clearly provide the feed base for grazing livestock and thus numerous high-quality foods, but such livestock also provide products such as fertilizer, transport, traction, fibre and leather. In addition, grasslands provide important services and roles including as water catchments, biodiversity reserves, for cultural and recreational needs, and potentially a carbon sink to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions. Inevitably, such functions may conflict with management for production of livestock products. Much of the increasing global demand for meat and milk, particularly from developing countries, will have to be supplied from grassland ecosystems, and this will provide difficult challenges. Increased production of meat and milk generally requires increased intake of metabolizable energy, and thus increased voluntary intake and/or digestibility of diets selected by grazing animals. These will require more widespread and effective application of improved management. Strategies to improve productivity include fertilizer application, grazing management, greater use of crop by-products, legumes and supplements and manipulation of stocking rate and herbage allowance. However, it is often difficult to predict the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of such strategies, particularly in tropical developing country production systems. Evaluation and on-going adjustment of grazing systems require appropriate and reliable assessment criteria, but these are often lacking. A number of emerging technologies may contribute to timely low-cost acquisition of quantitative information to better understand the soil-pasture-animal interactions and animal management in grassland systems. Development of remote imaging of vegetation, global positioning technology, improved diet markers, near IR spectroscopy and modelling provide improved tools for knowledge-based decisions on the productivity constraints of grazing animals. Individual electronic identification of animals offers opportunities for precision management on an individual animal basis for improved productivity. Improved outcomes in the form of livestock products, services and/or other outcomes from grasslands should be possible, but clearly a diversity of solutions are needed for the vast range of environments and social circumstances of global grasslands.",2012,218,11,10.1017/S1751731112000304,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8f69e420ce1ced46c518fcfd3484af1c672e7fee,"Review,JournalArticle",Animal

48cbb02e8371a7ed1f48137b2ddfa32469eacd12,Automatic Detection of Animals in Mowing Operations Using Thermal Cameras,"During the last decades, high-efficiency farming equipment has been developed in the agricultural sector. This has also included efficiency improvement of moving techniques, which include increased working speeds and widths. Therefore, the risk of wild animals being accidentally injured or killed during routine farming operations has increased dramatically over the years. In particular, the nests of ground nesting bird species like grey partridge (Perdix perdix) or pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) are vulnerable to farming operations in their breeding habitat, whereas in mammals, the natural instinct of e.g., leverets of brown hare (Lepus europaeus) and fawns of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) to lay low and still in the vegetation to avoid predators increase their risk of being killed or injured in farming operations. Various methods and approaches have been used to reduce wildlife mortality resulting from farming operations. However, since wildlife-friendly farming often results in lower efficiency, attempts have been made to develop automatic systems capable of detecting wild animals in the crop. Here we assessed the suitability of thermal imaging in combination with digital image processing to automatically detect a chicken (Gallus domesticus) and a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in a grassland habitat. Throughout the different test scenarios, our study animals were detected with a high precision, although the most dense grass cover reduced the detection rate. We conclude that thermal imaging and digital imaging processing may be an important tool for the improvement of wildlife-friendly farming practices in the future.",2012,54,2,10.3390/s120607587,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48cbb02e8371a7ed1f48137b2ddfa32469eacd12,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors
104883849f5e9c8bd8ce5ee5931461ed67ed7fa7,"Integrated genomics, physiology and breeding approaches for improving drought tolerance in crops","Drought is one of the most serious production constraint for world agriculture and is projected to worsen with anticipated climate change. Inter-disciplinary scientists have been trying to understand and dissect the mechanisms of plant tolerance to drought stress using a variety of approaches; however, success has been limited. Modern genomics and genetic approaches coupled with advances in precise phenotyping and breeding methodologies are expected to more effectively unravel the genes and metabolic pathways that confer drought tolerance in crops. This article discusses the most recent advances in plant physiology for precision phenotyping of drought response, a vital step before implementing the genetic and molecular-physiological strategies to unravel the complex multilayered drought tolerance mechanism and further exploration using molecular breeding approaches for crop improvement. Emphasis has been given to molecular dissection of drought tolerance by QTL or gene discovery through linkage and association mapping, QTL cloning, candidate gene identification, transcriptomics and functional genomics. Molecular breeding approaches such as marker-assisted backcrossing, marker-assisted recurrent selection and genome-wide selection have been suggested to be integrated in crop improvement strategies to develop drought-tolerant cultivars that will enhance food security in the context of a changing and more variable climate.",2012,460,13,10.1007/s00122-012-1904-9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/104883849f5e9c8bd8ce5ee5931461ed67ed7fa7,"Review,JournalArticle",Theoretical and Applied Genetics

In addition, because the conditions at different locations in plant beds differ, in situ measurements in agriculture need to be done in small localized areas. We have fabricated a multimodal sensor on a small Si chip in which a pH sensor was integrated with electrical conductivity (EC) and temperature sensors. An ISFET with a Si3N4 membrane was used for the pH sensor. For the EC sensor, the electrical conductivity between platinum electrodes was measured, and the temperature sensor was a p-n junction diode. These are some of the most important measurements required for controlling the conditions in plant beds. The multimodal sensor can be inserted into a plant bed for in situ monitoring. To confirm the absence of crosstalk between the sensors, we made simultaneous measurements of pH, EC, and temperature of a pH buffer solution in a plant bed. When the solution was diluted with hot or cold water, the real time measurements showed changes to the EC and temperature, but no change in pH. We also demonstrated that our sensor was capable of simultaneous in situ measurements in rock wool without being affected by crosstalk.",2012,66,0,10.3390/s120608338,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/453760e7a55bd8068569bf3611bcb0067b0bc1da,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

674e0d589b67d9cf1d30fda0b061c58e0ac93a42,Sensor correction and radiometric calibration of a 6-band multispectral imaging sensor for UAV remote sensing,"Abstract. The increased availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has resulted in their frequent adoption for a growing range of remote sensing tasks which include precision agriculture, vegetation surveying and fine-scale topographic mapping. The development and utilisation of UAV platforms requires broad technical skills covering the three major facets of remote sensing: data acquisition, data post-processing, and image analysis. In this study, UAV image data acquired by a miniature 6-band multispectral imaging sensor was corrected and calibrated using practical image-based data post-processing techniques. Data correction techniques included dark offset subtraction to reduce sensor noise, flat-field derived per-pixel look-up-tables to correct vignetting, and implementation of the Brown- Conrady model to correct lens distortion. Radiometric calibration was conducted with an image-based empirical line model using pseudo-invariant features (PIFs). Sensor corrections and radiometric calibration improve the quality of the data, aiding quantitative analysis and generating consistency with other calibrated datasets.",2012,52,6,10.5194/ISPRSARCHIVES-XXXIX-B1-393-2012,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/674e0d589b67d9cf1d30fda0b061c58e0ac93a42,Review,

With state-of-the-art sensors, the achieved point clouds capture object details with good accuracy and precision. Many of the applications involve civil engineering in urban areas, as well as traffic and other urban planning, all of which serve to make 3D city modeling probably the fastest growing market segment in this field. This article outlines multiplatform mobile laser scanning solutions such as vehicle- and trolley-operated urban area data acquisition, and boat-mounted equipment for fluvial environments. Moreover, we introduce a novel backpack version of mobile laser scanning equipment for surveying applications in the field of natural sciences where the requirements include precision and mobility in variable terrain conditions. In addition to presenting a technical description of the systems, we discuss the performance of the solutions in the light of various applications in the fields of urban mapping and modeling, fluvial geomorphology, snow-cover characterization, precision agriculture, and in monitoring the effects of climate change on permafrost landforms. The data performance of the mobile laser scanning approach is described by the results of an evaluation of the ROAMER on a permanent MLS test field.

0a2579b3e7328760acaddd2f05f2982c91f8833d,Towards Autonomous Agriculture: Automatic Ground Detection Using Trinocular Stereovision,"Autonomous driving is a challenging problem, particularly when the domain is unstructured, as in an outdoor agricultural setting. Thus, advanced perception systems are primarily required to sense and understand the surrounding environment recognizing artificial and natural structures, topology, vegetation and paths. In this paper, a self-learning framework is proposed to automatically train a ground classifier for scene interpretation and autonomous navigation based on multi-baseline stereovision. The use of rich 3D data is emphasized where the sensor output includes range and color information of the surrounding environment. Two distinct classifiers are presented, one based on geometric data that can detect the broad class of ground and one based on color data that can further segment ground into subclasses. The geometry-based classifier features two main stages: an adaptive training stage and a classification stage. During the training stage, the system automatically learns to associate geometric appearance of 3D stereo-generated data with class labels. Then, it makes predictions based on past observations. It serves as well to provide training labels to the color-based classifier. Once trained, the color-based classifier is able to recognize similar terrain classes in stereo imagery. The system is continuously updated online using the latest stereo readings, thus making it feasible for long range and long duration navigation, over changing environments. Experimental results, obtained with a tractor test platform operating in a rural environment, are presented to validate this approach, showing an average classification precision and recall of 91.0% and 77.3%, respectively.",2012,59,1,10.3390/s120912405,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a2579b3e7328760acaddd2f05f2982c91f8833d,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors
020d517688e704ead23786f5e99c17016df415be,More Than Counting Beans: Adapting USDA Data Collection Practices To Track Marketing Channel Diversification,"In order to differentiate their products, agricultural producers are expanding and diversifying their use of marketing channels. Increasingly, these channels convey farm-level information to the final purchaser. However, the Census of Agriculture, the longest-running U.S. farm survey, tracks only three forms of market differentiation: direct-to-consumer sales, organic sales, and the number of community supported agriculture farms. Current Congressional proposals to increase data collection on market channel diversification rely on ""follow-on"" surveys and the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Both of these surveys are more limited than the Census of Agriculture in observing farm-level trends; the follow-on survey is particularly limited in providing results that are comparable to all farms and even farms within the same sector. This paper will show that administrative reporting changes in the 2012 census and the introduction of new questions for the 2017 census can improve both farm-level and sector-level observations on marketing channel usage — with greater precision than tracking local and regional food systems. Such data is needed to assist policy-makers, technical assistance providers, and farm lenders in providing resources to the relatively high portion of young, beginning, and full-time producers involved in market channel differentiation.",2012,4,1,10.5304/JAFSCD.2012.024.010,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/020d517688e704ead23786f5e99c17016df415be,Review,

As our natural resources are depleting and our nature changing due to the human activity – sustainability is an emerging issue. In short sustainable agriculture means a system which preserves the basis of life of future generations. In the case of animal production this includes the following key areas: providing sustainable feed base, reducing environmental impact, feed and food safety and sustainable intensification. Animal production systems can be intensified throughout the application of precision livestock farming (PLF) systems. As the majority of production expenses related to feed, precision nutrition is a key component in PLF systems. Precision nutrition includes the following principles: use of precise nutrient requirement matrix, use of precise ingredient matrix, proper use of modifiers and feed processing technologies and adjustment of nutrient supply to match requirements of livestock. The aim of this paper is to highlight the current standing and future perspectives of sustainable animal production and precision nutrition.",2012,0,0,10.14720/aas-s.2012.3.19066,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f79a1de8c6b0be6476f00a189019280fb429cfa,JournalArticle,Acta agriculturae slovenica.

c40b46537495cd3b3058fab37172af52835571df,"An Automated Cropland Classification Algorithm (ACCA) for Tajikistan by Combining Landsat, MODIS, and Secondary Data","The overarching goal of this research was to develop and demonstrate an automated Cropland Classification Algorithm (ACCA) that will rapidly, routinely, and accurately classify agricultural cropland extent, areas, and characteristics (e.g., irrigated vs. rainfed) over large areas such as a country or a region through combination of multi-sensor remote sensing and secondary data. In this research, a rule-based ACCA was conceptualized, developed, and demonstrated for the country of Tajikistan using mega file data cubes (MFDCs) involving data from Landsat Global Land Survey (GLS), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 30 m, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m time-series, a suite of secondary data (e.g., elevation, slope, precipitation, temperature), and in situ data. First, the process involved producing an accurate reference (or truth) cropland layer (TCL), consisting of cropland extent, areas, and irrigated vs. rainfed cropland areas, for the entire country of Tajikistan based on MFDC of year 2005 (MFDC2005). The methods involved in producing TCL included using ISOCLASS clustering, Tasseled Cap bi-spectral plots, spectro-temporal characteristics from MODIS 250 m monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maximum value composites (MVC) time-series, and textural characteristics of higher resolution imagery. The TCL statistics accurately matched with the national statistics of Tajikistan for irrigated and rainfed croplands, where about 70% of croplands were irrigated and the rest rainfed. Second, a rule-based ACCA was developed to replicate the TCL accurately (~80% producer’s and user’s accuracies or within 20% quantity disagreement involving about 10 million Landsat 30 m sized cropland pixels of Tajikistan). Development of ACCA was an iterative process involving series of rules that are coded, refined, tweaked, and re-coded till ACCA derived croplands (ACLs) match accurately with TCLs. Third, the ACCA derived cropland layers of Tajikistan were produced for year 2005 (ACL2005), same year as the year used for developing ACCA, using MFDC2005. Fourth, TCL for year 2010 (TCL2010), an independent year, was produced using MFDC2010 using the same methods and approaches as the one used to produce TCL2005. Fifth, the ACCA was applied on MFDC2010 to derive ACL2010. The ACLs were then compared with TCLs (ACL2005 vs. TCL2005 and ACL2010 vs. TCL2010). The resulting accuracies and errors from error matrices involving about 152 million Landsat (30 m) pixels of the country of Tajikistan (of which about 10 million Landsat size, 30 m, cropland pixels) showed an overall accuracy of 99.6% (khat = 0.97) for ACL2005 vs. TCL2005. For the 3 classes (irrigated, rainfed, and others) mapped in ACL2005, the producer’s accuracy was >86.4% and users accuracy was >93.6%. For ACL2010 vs. TCL2010, the error matrix showed an overall accuracy on 96.2% (khat = 0.96). For the 3 classes (irrigated, rainfed, and others) mapped in ACL2010, the producer’s and user’s accuracies for the irrigated areas were ≥82.9%. Any intermixing was overwhelmingly between irrigated and rainfed croplands, indicating that croplands (irrigated plus rainfed areas) as well as irrigated areas were mapped with high levels of accuracies (~90% or higher) even for the independent year. The ACL2005 and ACL2010, each, were produced using ACCA algorithm in ~30 min using a Dell Precision desktop T7400 computer for the entire country of Tajikistan once the MFDCs for the years were ready. The ACCA algorithm for Tajikistan is made available through US Geological Survey’s ScienceBase: http://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/folder/4f79f1b7e4b0009bd827f548 or at: https://powellcenter.usgs.gov/globalcroplandwater/content/models-algorithms. The research contributes to the efforts of global food security through research on global croplands and their water use (e.g., https://powellcenter.usgs.gov/globalcroplandwater/). The above results clearly demonstrated the ability of a rule-based ACCA to rapidly and accurately produce cropland data layer year after year (hindcast, nowcast, forecast) for the country it was developed using MFDCs that consist of combining multiple sensor data and secondary data. It needs to be noted that the ACCA is applicable to the area (e.g., country, region) for which it is developed. In this case, ACCA is applicable for the Country of Tajikistan to hindcast, nowcast, and forecast agricultural cropland extent, areas, and irrigated vs. rainfed. The same fundamental concept of ACCA applies to other areas of the World where ACCA codes need to be modified to suite the area/region of interest.

In this study we investigate a time series of ancient and contemporary DNA from Norwegian red deer spanning about 7,000 years. Our main aim was to investigate how increasing agricultural land use, hunting pressure and possibly human mediated translocation of animals have affected the genetic diversity on a long-term scale.ResultsWe obtained mtDNA (D-loop) sequences from 73 ancient specimens. These show higher genetic diversity in ancient compared to extant samples, with the highest diversity preceding the onset of agricultural intensification in the Early Iron Age. Using standard diversity indices, Bayesian skyline plot and approximate Bayesian computation, we detected a population reduction which was more prolonged than, but not as severe as, historic documents indicate. There are signs of substantial changes in haplotype frequencies primarily due to loss of haplotypes through genetic drift. There is no indication of human mediated translocations into the Norwegian population. All the Norwegian sequences show a western European origin, from which the Norwegian lineage diverged approximately 15,000 years ago.ConclusionsOur results provide direct insight into the effects of increasing habitat fragmentation and human hunting pressure on genetic diversity and structure of red deer populations. They also shed light on the northward post-glacial colonisation process of red deer in Europe and suggest increased precision in inferring past demographic events when including both ancient and contemporary DNA.",2012,25,2,10.1186/1471-2148-12-191,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03034b7464389f47c8d42656d09ae6c06cf7e362,JournalArticle,BMC Evolutionary Biology

Precision agriculture involves knowledge-based technical management systems to optimize application of fertilizer, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation resources to reduce input costs and to enhance crop yield while simultaneously reducing harmful environmental impacts associated with inefficient use of agricultural inputs. It also uses GPS-based auto-guidance systems in agricultural vehicles to reduce overlapping of equipment and tractor passes, thus saving fuel, labor, time, and soil compaction with environmental benefit.MethodsThis study was undertaken to quantify the fuel and labor savings resulting from adoption of precision agricultural technology in the upper mid-west state of North Dakota in the USA. A survey was conducted with responses from farmers of various demographics about savings of time and fuel in their agricultural vehicle by the use of GPS guidance and autosteering systems.ResultsIt was found that 34% farms used GPS guidance systems, reducing machine time and fuel consumption by 6.04% and 6.32%, respectively. Twenty-seven percent of the farms used autosteering systems, which further reduced machine time by 5.75% and fuel consumption by 5.33%. GPS guidance and autosteering systems can save an average of 1,647 and 1,866 L of fuel per farm respectively. The monetized values of time saved for the average farm are US$733.85 and US$851.27 for GPS guidance and autosteering systems, respectively.ConclusionsThe farm energy savings in terms of fuel and time by using GPS guidance and/or autosteering systems in farm vehicles in the Upper-Midwest region of the USA was estimated from the survey results.

Specifically, the paper describes an IMS which was set up in Manja township, city of Blantyre. Deployment of IMS in rural areas of developing countries like Malawi is a challenge as grid power is scarce. For the system to be self-sustained in terms of power, the study used solar photovoltaic and rechargeable batteries to power all electrical devices. The system incorporated a remote monitoring mechanism through a General Packet Radio Service modem to report soil temperature, soil moisture, WSN link performance, and photovoltaic power levels. Irrigation valves were activated to water the field. Preliminary results in this study have revealed a number of engineering weaknesses of deploying such a system. Nevertheless, the paper has highlighted areas of improvement to develop a robust, fully automated, solar-powered, and low-cost IMS to suit the socioeconomic conditions of small scale farmers in developing countries.",2012,168,2,10.1155/2013/150703,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07764ad033addea96b2dc0629b47dc2b4c5ba15c,"JournalArticle,Conference",IEEE International Conference on Networked Embedded Systems for Enterprise Applications

fb61f0871307ecf73fcc87bb80b8ac0e5e802d4c,Strategy for the Development of a Smart NDVI Camera System for Outdoor Plant Detection and Agricultural Embedded Systems,"The application of (smart) cameras for process control, mapping, and advanced imaging in agriculture has become an element of precision farming that facilitates the conservation of fertilizer, pesticides, and machine time. This technique additionally reduces the amount of energy required in terms of fuel. Although research activities have increased in this field, high camera prices reflect low adaptation to applications in all fields of agriculture. Smart, low-cost cameras adapted for agricultural applications can overcome this drawback. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each image pixel is an applicable algorithm to discriminate plant information from the soil background enabled by a large difference in the reflectance between the near infrared (NIR) and the red channel optical frequency band. Two aligned charge coupled device (CCD) chips for the red and NIR channel are typically used, but they are expensive because of the precise optical alignment required. Therefore, much attention has been given to the development of alternative camera designs. In this study, the advantage of a smart one-chip camera design with NDVI image performance is demonstrated in terms of low cost and simplified design. The required assembly and pixel modifications are described, and new algorithms for establishing an enhanced NDVI image quality for data processing are discussed.",2013,54,0,10.3390/s130201523,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fb61f0871307ecf73fcc87bb80b8ac0e5e802d4c,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

Representative case studies are presented in the special issue ""Advances in Remote Sensing of Agriculture"". To complement the examples published within the special issue, a few main applications with regional to global focus were selected for this review, where remote sensing contributions are traditionally strong. The selected applications are put in the context of the global challenges the agricultural sector is facing: minimizing the environmental impact, while increasing production and productivity. Five different applications have been selected, which are illustrated and described: (1) biomass and yield estimation, (2) vegetation vigor and drought stress monitoring, (3) assessment of crop phenological development, (4) crop acreage estimation and cropland mapping and (5) mapping of disturbances and land use/land cover (LULC) changes. Many other applications exist, such as precision agriculture and irrigation management (see other special issues of this journal), but were not included to keep the paper concise. The paper starts with an overview of the main agricultural challenges. This section is followed by a brief overview of existing operational monitoring systems. Finally, in the main part of the paper, the mentioned applications are described and illustrated.

17544fd4c1de50fc4505f50f979e34aea44a0c8b,Overcoming the risk of inaction from emissions uncertainty in smallholder agriculture,"The potential for improving productivity and increasing the resilience of smallholder agriculture, while also contributing to climate change mitigation, has recently received considerable political attention (Beddington et al 2012). Financial support for improving smallholder agriculture could come from performance-based funding including sale of carbon credits or certified commodities, payments for ecosystem services, and nationally appropriate mitigation action (NAMA) budgets, as well as more traditional sources of development and environment finance. Monitoring the greenhouse gas fluxes associated with changes to agricultural practice is needed for performance-based mitigation funding, and efforts are underway to develop tools to quantify mitigation achieved and assess trade-offs and synergies between mitigation and other livelihood and environmental priorities (Olander 2012). High levels of small scale variability in carbon stocks and emissions in smallholder agricultural systems (Ziegler et al 2012) mean that data intensive approaches are needed for precise and unbiased mitigation monitoring. The cost of implementing such monitoring programmes is likely to be high, and this introduces the risk that projects will not be developed in areas where there is the greatest need for agricultural improvements, which are likely to correspond with areas where existing data or research infrastructure are lacking. When improvements to livelihoods and food security are expected as co-benefits of performance-based mitigation finance, the risk of inaction is borne by the rural poor as well as the global climate. In situ measurement of carbon accumulation in smallholders’ soils are not usually feasible because of the costs associated with sampling in a heterogeneous landscape, although technological advances could improve the situation (Milori et al 2012). Alternatives to in situ measurement are to estimate greenhouse gas fluxes by extrapolating information from existing research to other areas with similar land uses and environmental conditions, or to combine information on land use activities with process-based models that describe expected emissions and carbon accumulation under specified conditions. Unfortunately long-term studies that have measured biomass and soil organic carbon accumulation in smallholder agriculture are scarce, and default values developed for national level emissions assessments (IPCC 2006) fail to capture local variability and may not scale linearly, so cannot be applied at the project scale without introducing considerable uncertainty and the potential for bias. If there is reliable information on the agricultural activities and environmental conditions at a project site, process-based models can provide accurate estimations of agricultural greenhouse gas fluxes that capture temporal and spatial variability (Olander 2012) but collecting the necessary data to parameterize and drive the models can be costly and time consuming. Assessing and monitoring greenhouse gas fluxes in smallholder agriculture therefore involves a balance between the resources required to collect information from thousands of smallholders across large areas, and the accuracy and precision of model predictions. Accuracy, or the absence of bias, is clearly an important consideration in the quantification of mitigation benefits for performance-based finance since a bias towards over-estimation of mitigation achieved would risk misallocating limited finance to projects that have not achieved mitigation benefits. Such a bias would also lead to a net increase in emissions if credits were used to offset emissions elsewhere. The accuracy of model predictions is related to uncertainty in model input data, which affects the precision of predictions, and errors in the model structure (Olander 2012). To limit the risk that projects receive credit for mitigation benefits that are not real, a precise-or-conservative approach to carbon accounting has emerged that requires projects to report mitigation benefits to a prescribed level of precision—for example with a 90% confidence interval that is less than 20% of the estimated mitigation benefit; and if this level of precision is not reached then the lower confidence limit of the value is encouraged (VCS 2012). This helps to ensure projects that lack precision in their estimates are biased towards an underestimation of mitigation benefits, which helps limit the risk of increasing net greenhouse gas emissions. It can also mean that finance from the sale of emission reduction certificates is insufficient to support smallholder agricultural projects without donor assistance to cover the cost of project establishment (Seebauer et al 2012). Understanding the mitigation benefits of improving agricultural practice is important for many purposes other than developing carbon offsets however, and with appropriate accounting approaches risks to smallholders can be reduced and scarce resources channelled to improving land use practices. Less precision is tolerable when making payments for a broad range ecosystem services, or assessing the impacts of donor support, than it is for industrial carbon offsets. Approaches that have greater uncertainty in expected emission reductions or removals may therefore be more appropriate if there is an equal emphasis on the livelihood and environmental benefits of projects as there is on mitigation benefits. One way to balance the risk of inaction against the need for accuracy is to use process-based models in greenhouse gas accounting and decision support tools, which give users control over the precision and cost of their accounting. Such models can be parameterized and driven using readily available information or best estimates for input data, as well as site specific environmental and activity data. The potential for bias in model predictions can be limited by making use of appropriate models that are validated against regionally specific data. Although process-based models have been adopted for quantifying mitigation benefit in smallholder agriculture systems (for example Seebauer et al 2012), their use is currently limited to those with specialist knowledge or access to detailed site specific information. Web-based tools that link existing global, regional, and local environmental data with process-based models (such as RothC (Coleman and Jenkinson 1996), CENTURY (Parton et al 1987), DNDC (Li et al 1994) and DAYCENT (Del Grosso et al 2002)) that have been validated for specific areas allow users to generate initial estimates of the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural systems simply by specifying the location and intervention. This can support assessments of the feasibility of supporting these interventions through various funding sources. The same tools can also generate accurate, site specific assessments and monitoring to varying levels of detail, when required, given the inclusion of new data collected in situ . When accounting for greenhouse gases in smallholder agriculture systems users should be free to decide whether it is worthwhile to invest in collecting input data to estimate mitigation benefits with sufficient precision to meet the requirements for carbon offsets, or if greater uncertainty is tolerable. By using tools that do not require specialist support and accepting estimates of mitigation benefits that are less precise, and not necessarily conservative, those providing performance-based finance can help ensure that a greater proportion of limited budgets are spent on the activities that directly benefit smallholders and that are likely to benefit the global climate. The Small-Holder Agriculture Monitoring and Baseline Assessment methodology and prototype tool (SHAMBA 2012), which has been trialled with fifteen agroforestry and conservation agriculture projects in Malawi and is currently under review for validation under the Plan Vivo Standard (Plan Vivo 2012), provides a proof of this concept and a platform on which greater functionality and flexibility can be built. We hope that this, and other similar initiatives, will deliver approaches to greenhouse gas accounting that reduce risks and maximize benefits to smallholder farmers.

c48fe48516bbc20f97cada2832b36219b5ed0e91,Testing the Temporal Ability of Landsat Imagery and Precision Agriculture Technology to Provide High Resolution Historical Estimates of Wheat Yield at the Farm Scale,"The long term archiving of both Landsat imagery and wheat yield mapping datasets sensed by precision agriculture technology has the potential through the development of statistical relationships to predict high resolution estimates of wheat yield over large areas for multiple seasons. Quantifying past yield performance over different growing seasons can inform agricultural management decisions ranging from fertilizer applications at the sub-paddock scale to changes in land use at a landscape scale. However, an understanding of the magnitude of prediction errors is needed. In this study, we examine the predictive wheat yield relationships developed from Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) acquired Landsat imagery and combine-mounted yield monitors for three Western Australian farms over different growing seasons. We further analysed their predictive capability when these relationships are used to extrapolate yield from one farm to another. Over all seasons, the best predictions were achieved with imagery acquired in September. Of the five seasons reviewed, three showed very reasonable prediction accuracies, with the low and high rainfall years providing good predictions. Medium rainfall years showed the greatest variation in prediction accuracy with marginal to poor predictions resulting from narrow ranges of measured wheat yield and NDVI values. These results demonstrate the potential benefit of fusing together two high resolution datasets to create robust wheat yield prediction models over different growing seasons, the outputs of which can be used to inform agricultural decision making.",2013,36,3,10.3390/rs5041549,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c48fe48516bbc20f97cada2832b36219b5ed0e91,"JournalArticle,Review",Remote Sensing

Accuracy of identification and detection is an important issue to be addressed in image processing. There are two main types of parameters affecting the accuracy of the images, namely: (a) extrinsic, related to the sensor's positioning in the tractor; (b) intrinsic, related to the sensor specifications, such as CCD resolution, focal length or iris aperture, among others. Moreover, in agricultural applications, the uncontrolled illumination, existing in outdoor environments, is also an important factor affecting the image accuracy. This paper is exclusively focused on two main issues, always with the goal to achieve the highest image accuracy in Precision Agriculture applications, making the following two main contributions: (a) camera sensor arrangement, to adjust extrinsic parameters and (b) design of strategies for controlling the adverse illumination effects.",2013,39,3,10.3390/s130404348,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eac8318715a6610d2f3f976a530ecbb0b010e7b8,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

a1a4c8da018d1890808e37b1908b7d0aee087ea5,Mapas de aplicação localizada de insumos e técnicas para agricultura familiar,"In Brazil, family farming is an activity that has emerged during the Portuguese empire, and had a major expansion later, with the arrival of immigrants in the nineteenth century. During the recession caused by the 1929 crisis, which led many farmers to bankruptcy, these immigrants bought small plots of land, thus increasing the number of these establishments. Nevertheless, Brazil still maintains a history of agricultural production on farms. So, historically, family farms got in the background, receiving less encouragement and direction from public policy, which brings about great technological backwardness compared to large producers. In this sense, it is now known that by using rudimentary techniques many small farmers are unable to compete in the market. Thus, this project was proposed in order to meet family farmers seeking for support and instructions for handling their properties economically viable and environmentally sustainable, based on assumptions of precision agriculture. This action also tries to ensure the permanence of these farmers in the field, both for preserving natural resources and also for reducing their spending on inputs by applying appropriate localized doses and preparing soil tillage according to the need. The objective was to create physical and chemical soil maps of their properties, aiming at providing information needed for input and technique applications most appropriately and accurately.",2013,1,0,10.23901/1679-4605.2013v9n1p135-149,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a1a4c8da018d1890808e37b1908b7d0aee087ea5,JournalArticle,Revista Ciência em Extensão

This paper describes the development of a sensor equipped with RTK-GPS technology that continuously and efficiently measures soil cutting resistance at various depths while traversing the field. Laboratory and preliminary field tests verified the accuracy of this prototype soil strength sensor. The data obtained using a hand-operated soil cone penetrometer was used to evaluate this field soil compaction depth profile sensor. To date, this sensor has only been tested in one field under one gravimetric water content condition. This field test revealed that the relationships between the soil strength profile sensor (SSPS) cutting force and soil cone index values are assumed to be quadratic for the various depths considered: 0–10, 10–20 and 20–30 cm (r2 = 0.58, 0.45 and 0.54, respectively). Soil resistance contour maps illustrated its practical value.

9e234417d13d3eda6e0baad3f8544f1d4653215f,Climate change and food security,"This paper discusses the complex nature of climate change-food security linkages, focusing on how a planet under warming affects food governance at global levels. With changing rainfall patterns, high temperature levels and increases in frequency of severe weather events conventional agricultural practices are endangered by the disruptions in crop yields water availability. Disadvantage areas, usually subsistence farmers, have been hit by more food insufficiency risks. The paper highlights the need for adaptive strategies and resilient agricultural methods to combat the effects of climate change on food productivity. Agriculture emerges as a vital solution, focusing on precision farming, agro ecology and technological innovations which use resources efficiently without affecting the environment. These strategies will require global coordination since climate change does not have borders and affects people all over the world. In addition, the article discusses social and economic aspects of food insecurity linked to climate change that significantly affect deprived groups. It promotes policies that consider the weak points of smallholder farmers and strengthen local communities. Educational initiatives and campaigns create a sense of collective awareness about the challenges that are being faced. The article ends by pointing out the need for immediate and coordinated worldwide efforts to strengthen resilience, ensure food sustainability, and secure future food security with a changing climate.

705db7803a32a48c297240e300ef651794c51e44,Mobile sensor platforms: categorisation and research applications in precision farming,"Abstract. The usage of mobile sensor platforms arose in research a few decades ago. Since the beginning of satellite sensing, measurement principles and analysing methods have become widely implemented for aerial and ground vehicles. Mainly in Europe, the United States and Australia, sensor platforms in precision farming are used for surveying, monitoring and scouting tasks. This review gives an overview of available sensor platforms used in recent agricultural and related research projects. A general categorisation tree for platforms is outlined in this work. Working in manual, automatic or autonomous ways, these ground platforms and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) with an agricultural scope are presented with their sensor equipment and the possible architectural models. Thanks to advances in highly powerful electronics, smaller devices mounted on platforms have become economically feasible for many applications. Designed to work automatically or autonomously, they will be able to interact in intelligent swarms. Sensor platforms can fulfil the need for developing, testing and optimising new applications in precision farming like weed control or pest management. Furthermore, commercial suppliers of platform hardware used in sensing tasks are listed.",2013,47,1,10.5194/JSSS-2-51-2013,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/705db7803a32a48c297240e300ef651794c51e44,Review,

Following a detailed survey, the research and extension needs of livestock producers were identified and several applied investigations were conducted to meet those needs and delivered through a range of extension activities. This final paper of the Cicerone Special Issue reflects on the entire Project from a wide array of perspectives, including livestock producers, researchers, extension specialists and staff employed by the Project, all of whom are authors of this paper. A notable early successful outcome of the Project was the improved precision of footrot diagnosis, which has been of value to the entire sheep industry, and that flowed from a field investigation of benign and virulent footrot combined with detailed genetic investigations, which led to an improved testing regime. This paper also reflects on the findings of an unreplicated agricultural ecosystem research trial, which measured the impact of pasture renovation, increased soil fertility and grazing management on the profitability and sustainability of three different 53-ha farmlets. Valuable findings from this whole-farmlet trial included the need for a high quality feed supply for increasing stocking rate and animal liveweights; the ability and utility of satellite imagery to detect changes in pasture growth, composition and recent grazing pressure; the value of short grazing and long rest periods for controlling Barber’s pole worms of sheep; the impact of increased stocking rates on whole-farm profitability and risk; methods of optimising decisions relating to pasture renovation, fertiliser applications and grazing management; and an integrated analysis of all key measured components of the farmlet management systems. Collectively, these findings were powerful as they were demonstrated at a scale credible to livestock producers using the ‘compare – measure – learn – adopt’ approach, which was the key philosophy adopted by the Cicerone Project. By comparing and measuring different whole-farm systems, and by ensuring that producers had ownership of the trial process, the Project successfully delivered objective findings that producers trusted and which increased our understanding of important drivers of complex grazing enterprises under variable climatic conditions. Some of these drivers included: the influence of soil phosphorus on botanical composition and subsequent livestock production, the role of pasture renovation and soil fertility on herbage supply, herbage quality and stocking rate, and the improved gastrointestinal nematode control delivered by intensive rotational grazing. The beneficiaries of the Project included the 180 farmer members who participated in some 61 field days and workshops; the research and extension collaborators including four postgraduates who completed their research investigations in conjunction with the Project; and some 500 undergraduate and 300 technical students who benefited from coming to understand the applied field comparisons of the three whole-farmlet systems. Having livestock producers play a significant leadership role led to valuable outcomes achieved with research collaborators; this should encourage the development of other learning partnerships which aim to explore complex farming system issues.",2013,3,0,10.1071/AN12292,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/68749770401f32804d5dae208a306396e2811a50,Review,

To this end, we have developed a precision phenotyping platform that combines various sensors for a non-invasive, high-throughput and high-dimensional phenotyping of small grain cereals. This platform yielded high prediction accuracies and heritabilities for biomass of triticale. Genetic variation for biomass accumulation was dissected with 647 doubled haploid lines derived from four families. Employing a genome-wide association mapping approach, two major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for biomass were identified and the genetic architecture of biomass accumulation was found to be characterized by dynamic temporal patterns. Our findings highlight the potential of precision phenotyping to assess the dynamic genetics of complex traits, especially those not amenable to traditional phenotyping.",2013,110,5,10.1038/srep02442,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64626432c0985ad99ffc7be7644dc5930f18c0cf,JournalArticle,Scientific Reports

44edfb2ff450896b7e238a6e9191c8c487bdc7a0,Sweeping beauty: is grassland arthropod community composition effectively estimated by sweep netting?,"Arthropods are critical ecosystem components due to their high diversity and sensitivity to perturbation. Furthermore, due to their ease of capture they are often the focus of environmental health surveys. There is much debate regarding the best sampling method to use in these surveys. Sweep netting and pan trapping are two sampling methods commonly used in agricultural arthropod surveys, but have not been contrasted in natural grassland systems at the community level. The purpose of this study was to determine whether sweep netting was effective at estimating arthropod diversity at the community level in grasslands or if supplemental pan trapping was needed. Arthropods were collected from grassland sites in Montana, USA, in the summer of 2011. The following three standardized evaluation criteria (consistency, reliability, and precision) were developed to assess the efficacy of sweep netting and pan trapping, based on analyses of variations in arthropod abundances, species richness, evenness, capture frequency, and community composition. Neither sampling method was sufficient in any criteria to be used alone for community-level arthropod surveys. On a taxa-specific basis, however, sweep netting was consistent, reliable, and precise for Thysanoptera, infrequently collected (i.e., rare) insects, and Arachnida, whereas pan trapping was consistent, reliable, and precise for Collembola and bees, which is especially significant given current threats to the latter's populations worldwide. Species-level identifications increase the detected dissimilarity between sweep netting and pan trapping. We recommend that community-level arthropod surveys use both sampling methods concurrently, at least in grasslands, but likely in most nonagricultural systems. Target surveys, such as monitoring bee communities in fragmented grassland habitat or where detailed information on behavior of the target arthropod groups is available can in some instances employ singular methods. As a general ecological principle, consistency, reliability, and precision are appropriate criteria to evaluate the applicability of a given sampling method for both community-level and taxa-specific arthropod surveys in any ecosystem.",2013,56,4,10.1002/ece3.688,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/44edfb2ff450896b7e238a6e9191c8c487bdc7a0,"JournalArticle,Review",Ecology and Evolution

36f000ea1aac3b548a09e57ea6cf73929a5c9e1a,Sensors in Agriculture and Forestry,"Agriculture and Forestry are two broad and promising areas demanding technological solutions with the aim of increasing production or accurate inventories for sustainability while the environmental impact is minimized by reducing the application of agro-chemicals and increasing the use of environmental friendly agronomical practices. In addition, the immediate consequence of this “trend” is the reduction of production costs. Sensors-based technologies provide appropriate tools to achieve the above mentioned goals. The explosive technological advances and development in recent years enormously facilitates the attainment of these objectives removing many barriers for their implementation, including the reservations expressed by the farmers themselves. Precision Agriculture is an emerging area where sensor-based technologies play an important role. Farmers, researchers and technical manufacturers, all together are joining their efforts to find efficient solutions, improvements in production and reductions in costs. The dissemination of results through scientific publications and international events, among which Sensors is a clear example, contributes significantly to this effort. This is the second special issue published in Sensors for the same topic (Agriculture and Forestry) with important contributions; some of them coming from the First International Conference on Robotics and associated High-technologies and Equipment (www.rhea-conference.eu/2012), emphasizing how much sensitivity and coverage Sensors offer for technological advancement in these areas.",2013,28,0,10.3390/s130912132,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36f000ea1aac3b548a09e57ea6cf73929a5c9e1a,"JournalArticle,Editorial",Italian National Conference on Sensors

8d95e45441df3b7c401d9544899e9c107c580194,Water Quality Regulations in the Chesapeake Bay: Working to More Precisely Estimate Nutrient Loading Rates and Incentivize Best Management Practices in the Nursery and Greenhouse Industry,"Restoration efforts in the Chesapeake Bay recently intensified with the 2010 introduction of federal total maximum daily load (TMDL) limits for all 92 bay watershed segments. These regulations have specific, binding consequences if any of the six states or the District of Columbia fail to meet interim goals, including loss of federal dollars for various programs and increasing regulation of point sources, if non-point source (agricultural and urban) nutrient reduction goals are not met in the watershed. As part of the effort to better understand and account for non-point sources of pollution in the watershed, a team of agricultural experts from across the bay region was recently assembled, including the nursery industry. The goal of this panel was to inform stakeholders and policymakers about the inputs and management practices used across all Bay states. To increase both the precision and accuracy of loading rate estimates, more precise information should guide future iterations of the Chesapeake Bay model. A more accurate accounting of land area by operation type (e.g., greenhouse, container, and field) is a primary issue for the nursery and greenhouse industry, because the current Chesapeake Bay model relies on USDA agricultural census data, which does not separate container and field production, which have very different nutrient and irrigation practices. Field operations also typically account for a higher percentage of production area in each state, which may skew model results. This is very important because the type of operation (field, container-nursery, or greenhouse operation) has a significant impact on plant density, types of fertilizer used, and application rates, which combine with irrigation and water management practices to affect potential nutrient runoff. It is also important to represent a variety of implemented best management practices (BMPs) in the Chesapeake Bay model such as vegetated buffer strips, sediment ponds, controlled-release fertilizer, and accurately assess how these mitigate both nutrient and sediment runoff from individual operations. There may also be opportunities for growers who have implemented BMPs such as low-phosphorus slow-release fertilizers (SRF), precision irrigation, etc., to gain additional revenue through nutrient trading. Although there are currently some questions about how nutrient trading will work, this could provide additional incentives for further implementation of BMPs by both ornamental and other agricultural growers. It is possible that the TMDL process currently being implemented throughout the Chesapeake Bay will be used as a remediation process for other impaired estuarine water bodies, which have similar water-use regulations and issues. The lessons learned about the Chesapeake Bay model in general, and for the nursery and greenhouse industry in particular, will likely provide guidance for how we can be proactive in reducing environmental impacts and protect the economic viability of ornamental growers in the future. A BRIEF HISTORY OF CHESAPEAKE BAY RESTORATION EFFORTS For almost 30 years, the Chesapeake Bay has been targeted for water quality improvements with the goal of removing the Bay and its tributaries from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 303(d) impaired waters list. During that time, a number of plans and agreements were put into place to achieve that goal. The first Chesapeake Bay Agreement was signed in 1983 (Chesapeake Bay Partnership, 1983) and was a voluntary partnership among Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, DC, and the EPA. This was soon replaced by an updated agreement in 1987, because it had no specific goals or methods to reach those goals. The 1987 agreement sought to reduce the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads entering the Bay by 40% by the year 2000 (Chesapeake Executive Council, 1987). This agreement included deadlines and reduction goals, but there were no consequences associated with the failure to meet those goals, and participation was voluntary. During this time, some moderate improvements in Bay health were achieved through education, habitat restoration, species management plans, increased implementation of BMPs, updates to wastewater treatment plants, and a reduction of heavy metals and other toxins (Chesapeake Executive Council, 1987). The 1992 amendment expanded restoration efforts to tributaries instead of just the main stem of the Bay and acknowledged that a reduction of upstream pollution would benefit the Bay overall (Chesapeake Executive Council, 1992). Additionally, there were increased efforts to control non-point source pollution, which was primarily attributed to agriculture, but urban sources were explicitly recognized as contributors. The agreement also sought to explore ‘‘cooperative relationships’’ with New York, Delaware, and West Virginia to reach out to the three additional states that have land area within the watershed. Although progress had been made in terms of nutrient and sediment reduction, the Bay’s heath did not drastically improve during the 1990s (Fig. 1). The 2000 agreement, which still only included Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Washington, DC, established load reductions for sediment and chemical contaminants as well as renewing the 40% reduction in N and P goals from 1985 levels (Chesapeake Executive Council, 2000). This agreement also included specific population goals for certain species including blue crabs, menhaden, and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). Once again, the outcomes of this process were not binding; however, a few months later in 2000, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with the EPA by all six states in the watershed and Washington, DC, in response Received for publication 4 Mar. 2013.

a6f64d196852cd07bdaa2a651023f4acf96eba2e,Noise levels of a track-laying tractor during field operations in the vineyard,"Noise in agriculture is one of the risk factors to be taken into account in the assessment of the health and safety of workers; in particular, it is known that the tractor is a source of high noise. The Italian Low Decree 81/2008 defined the requirements for assessing and managing noise risk identifying a number of procedures to be adopted at different noise levels to limit workers exposure. This paper concerns the analysis of the noise risk arising from the use of a tracklaying tractor during field operations carried out in the vineyard. The objective of this study was to evaluate the noise level that comes close to the ear of the operator driving the tractor measuring the values of equivalent sound level (Leq(A)) and peak sound pressure (LCpk). We considered four options related to the same tractor coupled with the following tools to perform some farming operations: rototilling, chisel plough, flail mowers and vibro farmer. We considered three test conditions: T1 in flat (slope 0%), T2 uphill and T3 downhill (both 30% slope). The instrument used for the measurements is a precision integrating portable sound level meter, class 1, model HD2110L by Delta OHM, Italy. Each survey lasted 2 minutes, with an interval of measurement equal to 0.5 s. The tests were performed in compliance with the standards ISO 9612 and ISO 9432. The results show that the measured sound levels exceed the limits allowed by the regulations in almost all the test conditions; values exceeding the threshold limit of 80 dB(A) were recorded coming up to a maximum value of 92.8 dB(A) for flail mowers in test T1. When limits imposed by the regulations are exceeded, the operator is obliged to wear the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment.",2013,3,1,10.4081/JAE.2013.396,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6f64d196852cd07bdaa2a651023f4acf96eba2e,Review,
163a653c4129fc339209530e2da71d6f242df931,A Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network Platform for Environmental Event Detection Dedicated to Precision Agriculture,"Precision agriculture has been considered as a new technique to improve agricultural production and support sustainable development by preserving planet resource and minimizing pollution. By monitoring different parameters of interest in a cultivated field, wireless sensor network (WSN) enables real-time decision making with regard to issues such as management of water resources for irrigation, choosing the optimum point for harvesting, estimating fertilizer requirements and predicting crop yield more accurately. In spite the tremendous advanced of scalar WSN in recent year, scalar WSN cannot meet all the requirements of ubiquitous intelligent environmental event detections because scalar data such as temperature, soil humidity, air humidity and light intensity are not rich enough to detect all the environmental events such as plant diseases and present of insects. Thus to fulfill those requirements multimedia data is needed. In this paper we present a robust multi-support and modular Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network (WMSN) platform, which is a type of wireless sensor network equipped with a low cost CCD camera. This WMSN platform may be used for diverse environmental event detections such as the presence of plant diseases and insects in precision agriculture applications.",2013,16,0,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/163a653c4129fc339209530e2da71d6f242df931,JournalArticle,arXiv.org

At least 16 chemicals from this class have been specifically banned by the 176th bulletin of the Chinese Department of Agriculture on breeding animals, and methods for monitoring the illicit use of β-agonists in animal feed are required. Herein, a method to quantify 20 β-agonists in feed, via analyte derivatization followed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, has been developed. The optimized method has a good linear correlation (calibration coefficient > 0.99) between the quantitative ion peak area and the concentration of β-agonists over a large working range (0.05–1 mg/kg). The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.01 mg/kg, the recoveries for three β-agonists spikes (0.05, 0.1, and 1 µg/g) in feed ranged from 75.6 to 102.4%, repeatability ranged from 1.2 to 9.4% for all of the compounds, and intermediate precisions were lower than 13.8%.

The new, tunable, Fabry-Perot interferometer-based (FPI) spectral camera, which weighs less than 700 g, makes it possible to collect spectrometric image blocks with stereoscopic overlaps using light-weight UAV platforms. This new technology is highly relevant, because it opens up new possibilities for measuring and monitoring the environment, which is becoming increasingly important for many environmental challenges. Our objectives were to investigate the processing and use of this new type of image data in precision agriculture. We developed the entire processing chain from raw images up to georeferenced reflectance images, digital surface models and biomass estimates. The processing integrates photogrammetric and quantitative remote sensing approaches. We carried out an empirical assessment using FPI spectral imagery collected at an agricultural wheat test site in the summer of 2012. Poor weather conditions during the campaign complicated the data processing, but this is one of the challenges that are faced in operational applications.

6b87670135a635c1d54df0c6f822d9935fc62f71,Precise plant height monitoring and biomass estimation with Terrestrial Laser Scanning in paddy rice,"Abstract. Optimizing crop management is a major topic in the field of precision agriculture as the growing world population puts pressure on the efficiency of field production. Accordingly, methods to measure plant parameters with the needed precision and within-field resolution are required. Studies show that Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) is a suitable method to capture small objects like crop plants. In this contribution, the results of multi-temporal surveys on paddy rice fields with the TLS system Riegl LMS-Z420i are presented. Three campaigns were carried out during the key vegetative stage of rice plants in the growing period 2012 to monitor the plant height. The TLS-derived point clouds are interpolated to visualize plant height above ground as crop surface models (CSMs) with a high resolution of 0.01 m. Spatio-temporal differences within the data of one campaign and between consecutive campaigns can be detected. The results were validated against manually measured plant heights with a high correlation (R2 = 0.71). Furthermore, the dependence of actual biomass from plant height was evaluated. To the present, no method for the non-destructive determination of biomass is found yet. Thus, plant parameters, like the height, have to be used for biomass estimations. The good correlation (R2 = 0.66) leads to the assumption that biomass can be estimated from plant height measurements. The results show that TLS can be considered as a very promising tool for precision agriculture.",2013,18,0,10.5194/ISPRSANNALS-II-5-W2-295-2013,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b87670135a635c1d54df0c6f822d9935fc62f71,Review,

cfa4c471e143b5af09c944a3838fe59c954e1bf2,Precision Farming Technology like the Tool of the Sustainable Agriculture in the Hungarian Practice,"Modern plant production systems are faced to numerous challenges, for example, they have to satisfy the growing food necessity with moderate environmental damage and to produce quality product with profit. The support of the food needs cannot be solved by giving up the chemicals. Many new or rediscovered technologies have appeared against the harmful effects of the chemicalization of the agricultural production without yield loss or with yield similarity (for example ecological, mid-tech farming and precision farming technologies). Precision farming technology should not be considered as only a modern plant production technology or only a new agro-management tool. In our opinion the precision farming technology is achieved only when the results of electronic and IT equipment are realized and can be differentiated in the variable rate treatments zone-by-zone. The biggest problem with the precision farming technology according to our opinion is that the possible advantages and disadvantages of the technology highly depend on the professional knowledge and attitude of the manager and the staff. Between the autumn 2010 and spring 2011 the own data collection was made for examining the knowledge about the precision farming technology among Hungarian farmers producing field crops. Some interviewed farmers have used precision farming technology for years, some have planned to adopt this technology and some have heard about the technology but does not want to use it. Adaptation of precision farming technology may bring both advantages and disadvantages. According to the scientific literature sources the most important advantage of precision farming technology is the decreasing of the negative environmental impacts. In the survey, non-precision farmers placed this advantage in the 1st place, according to the precision farming planners it was in the 2nd place, while according to the precision farmers this impact was only on the 8th place. Furthermore we examined the opinion of the farmers about the changes in percentages of operational cost, herbicide cost, fertilizer cost and human resource cost resulted by the adaptation of precision farming technology compared to the conventional technology. I used the box-plot analysis for this examination. In summary the biggest cost saving were in the fertilizer cost and herbicide cost according to the opinion of precision farmers.",2013,0,0,10.3390/WSF3-H002,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cfa4c471e143b5af09c944a3838fe59c954e1bf2,Review,

fc40077171f711769a7ece29f16e572fd29abd40,Proximal Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy to Predict Soil Properties Using Windows and Full-Spectrum Analysis Methods,"Fine-scale spatial information on soil properties is needed to successfully implement precision agriculture. Proximal gamma-ray spectroscopy has recently emerged as a promising tool to collect fine-scale soil information. The objective of this study was to evaluate a proximal gamma-ray spectrometer to predict several soil properties using energy-windows and full-spectrum analysis methods in two differently managed sandy loam fields: conventional and organic. In the conventional field, both methods predicted clay, pH and total nitrogen with a good accuracy (R2 ≥ 0.56) in the top 0–15 cm soil depth, whereas in the organic field, only clay content was predicted with such accuracy. The highest prediction accuracy was found for total nitrogen (R2 = 0.75) in the conventional field in the energy-windows method. Predictions were better in the top 0–15 cm soil depths than in the 15–30 cm soil depths for individual and combined fields. This implies that gamma-ray spectroscopy can generally benefit soil characterisation for annual crops where the condition of the seedbed is important. Small differences in soil structure (conventional vs. organic) cannot be determined. As for the methodology, we conclude that the energy-windows method can establish relations between radionuclide data and soil properties as accurate as the full-spectrum analysis method.",2013,47,4,10.3390/s131216263,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc40077171f711769a7ece29f16e572fd29abd40,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

bd4358391bd9393aeb45cb1c671658090849566e,The Effect of Differential Growth Rates across Plants on Spectral Predictions of Physiological Parameters,"Leaves of various ages and positions in a plant's canopy can present distinct physiological, morphological and anatomical characteristics, leading to complexities in selecting a single leaf for spectral representation of an entire plant. A fortiori, as growth rates between canopies differ, spectral-based comparisons across multiple plants – often based on leaves' position but not age – becomes an even more challenging mission. This study explores the effect of differential growth rates on the reflectance variability between leaves of different canopies, and its implication on physiological predictions made by widely-used spectral indices. Two distinct irrigation treatments were applied for one month, in order to trigger the formation of different growth rates between two groups of grapevines. Throughout the experiment, the plants were physiologically and morphologically monitored, while leaves from every part of their canopies were spectrally and histologically sampled. As the control vines were constantly developing new leaves, the water deficit plants were experiencing growth inhibition, resulting in leaves of different age at similar nodal position across the treatments. This modification of the age-position correlation was characterized by a near infrared reflectance difference between younger and older leaves, which was found to be exponentially correlated (R2 = 0.98) to the age-dependent area of intercellular air spaces within the spongy parenchyma. Overall, the foliage of the control plant became more spectrally variable, creating complications for intra- and inter-treatment leaf-based comparisons. Of the derived indices, the Structure-Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI) was found indifferent to the age-position effect, allowing the treatments to be compared at any nodal position, while a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-based stomatal conductance prediction was substantially affected by differential growth rates. As various biotic and abiotic factors may form distinctions in growth, future precision agriculture studies should consider its spectral effect on physiological predictions.",2014,28,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0088930,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bd4358391bd9393aeb45cb1c671658090849566e,JournalArticle,PLoS ONE

A wide variety of agricultural activities are running in Malaysia. Maintaining high quality of agricultural products with lower environmental impacts through a sustainable economic viability and life satisfaction of farmers and community are important factors helping to meet sustainable agriculture. Human resources are playing key role in directing the community toward sustainable development. The trend of improving the human development index in Malaysia is highest in the East Asia and the Pacific, high human development countries and the world, since 2000. Precision agriculture is providing strong tools to achieve sustainable agriculture. Different types of sensors, positioning and navigation systems, GIS, software and variable rate technology are well known components of precision agriculture. Drones and robots are promising tools that enabling farmers and managers to collect information or perform particular actions in remote areas or tough conditions. According to a survey, forestry and timber, rubber production and oil palm estates are three main agricultural divisions that precision agriculture may improve the productivity in respect to area of cropland/worker. Main factors affecting the adoption of precision agriculture in Malaysia are: a) Political and legal supports, b) Decision support systems and user interfaces c) Experienced research team works d) National educational policy e) Success in commercialization of precision agriculture system.",2014,8,0,10.1088/1755-1315/18/1/012142,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c3fa3f71b83ccc2d1fa3edc6dd9fb9cb37f6fae0,Review,
7653474c6388c372e40e7f17da56e318ce7f7f1d,Integrating Sensory/Actuation Systems in Agricultural Vehicles,"In recent years, there have been major advances in the development of new and more powerful perception systems for agriculture, such as computer-vision and global positioning systems. Due to these advances, the automation of agricultural tasks has received an important stimulus, especially in the area of selective weed control where high precision is essential for the proper use of resources and the implementation of more efficient treatments. Such autonomous agricultural systems incorporate and integrate perception systems for acquiring information from the environment, decision-making systems for interpreting and analyzing such information, and actuation systems that are responsible for performing the agricultural operations. These systems consist of different sensors, actuators, and computers that work synchronously in a specific architecture for the intended purpose. The main contribution of this paper is the selection, arrangement, integration, and synchronization of these systems to form a whole autonomous vehicle for agricultural applications. This type of vehicle has attracted growing interest, not only for researchers but also for manufacturers and farmers. The experimental results demonstrate the success and performance of the integrated system in guidance and weed control tasks in a maize field, indicating its utility and efficiency. The whole system is sufficiently flexible for use in other agricultural tasks with little effort and is another important contribution in the field of autonomous agricultural vehicles.",2014,46,0,10.3390/s140304014,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7653474c6388c372e40e7f17da56e318ce7f7f1d,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors
21503df232daeb5ae72f396b382f9b403468064a,Evaluation of Image Segmentation and Filtering With ANN in the Papaya Leaf,"Precision agriculture is area with lack of cheap technology. The refinement of the production system brings large advantages to the producer and the use of images makes the monitoring a more cheap methodology. Macronutrients monitoring can to determine the health and vulnerability of the plant in specific stages. In this paper is analyzed the method based on computational intelligence to work with image segmentation in the identification of symptoms of plant nutrient deficiency. Artificial neural networks are evaluated for image segmentation and filtering, several variations of parameters and insertion impulsive noise were evaluated too. Satisfactory results are achieved with artificial neural for segmentation same with high noise levels. Nowadays, a large sum of financial resources is destined for application of agricultural inputs by producers. The costs with agricultural inputs is a main factor in the permanent expenses of the production system. The soil degradation and crop can be caused by excess in the application of agricultural inputs. The technology adoption in the precision agriculture can avoid losses caused by wrong handling agricultural. In this way, the use efficient of fertilizers brings improve for both, producers and environment. A monitoring system suitable of the crop is necessary to achieve a correct decision-making and determine specific amounts of agricultural inputs. The macronutrient detection can provide recognition of a pattern that belong verify the plant status, independent of crop. Depending of the macronutrient, its excess or lack can be causes damage to the human and plant (1). Several works assess the correlation of the images in the domain spatial and spectral with greenness index or plant chlorophyll, and its relation with macronutrients deficiencies. The leaves observation by spectrometry with reflectance index identify of satisfactory form the alteration of macronutrients values as the N(Nitrogen), P (Phosphorus), K(Potassium), Ca (Calcium) and Mg (Magnesium) (2). The macronutrient (N) recognition by images are made in (3-5).

39df7aa52136bec3612e9c5329f8b725f64700b0,"Development and Application of Process-based Simulation Models for Cotton Production: A Review of Past, Present, and Future Directions","The development and application of cropping system simulation models for cotton production has a long and rich history, beginning in the southeastern U. S. in the 1960s and now expanded to major cotton production regions globally. This paper briefly reviews the history of cotton simulation models, examines applications of the models since the turn of the century, and identifies opportunities for improving models and their use in cotton research and decision support. Cotton models reviewed include those specific to cotton (GOSSYM, Cotton2K, COTCO2, OZCOT, and CROPGRO-Cotton) and generic crop models that have been applied to cotton production (EPIC, WOFOST, SUCROS, GRAMI, CropSyst, and AquaCrop). Model application areas included crop water use and irrigation water management, nitrogen dynamics and fertilizer management, genetics and crop improvement, climatology, global climate change, precision agriculture, model integration with sensor data, economics, and classroom instruction. Generally, the literature demonstrated increased emphasis on cotton model development in the previous century and on cotton model application in the current century. Although efforts to develop cotton models have a 40-year history, no comparisons among cotton models were reported. Such efforts would be advisable as an initial step to evaluate current cotton simulation strategies. Increasingly, cotton simulation models are being applied by nontraditional crop modelers, who are not trained agronomists but wish to use the models for broad economic or life-cycle analyses. Although this trend demonstrates the growing interest in the models and their potential utility for a variety of applications, it necessitates the development of models with appropriate complexity and ease-of-use for a given application, and improved documentation and teaching materials are needed to educate potential model users. Spatial scaling issues are also increasingly prominent, as models originally developed for use at the field scale are being implemented for regional simulations over large geographic areas. Research steadily progresses toward the advanced goal of model integration with variable-rate control systems, which use real-time crop status and environmental information to spatially and temporally optimize applications of crop inputs, while also considering potential environmental impacts, resource limitations, and climate forecasts. Overall, the review demonstrates a languished effort in cotton simulation model development, but the application of existing models in a variety of research areas remains strong and continues to grow.",2014,76,1,10.56454/oovc6073,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39df7aa52136bec3612e9c5329f8b725f64700b0,"JournalArticle,Review",Journal of Cotton Science

663649c0c7c595577d178433acb21be6a54f5ced,Feasibility of automated body trait determination using the SR4K time-of-flight camera in cow barns,"As herd sizes have increased in the last decades, computerized monitoring solutions, which provide fast, objective and accurate evaluations of the herd status, gain more and more importance. This study analyzes the feasibility of a Time-of-Flight-camera-based system for gathering body traits in dairy cows for use under cow barn conditions. Recording, determination of body condition score on a 5 point scale by visual and manual inspection, and measuring the backfat thickness with ultrasound took place from July 2011 to May 2012 at the dairy research farm Karkendamm of the Institute of Animal Breeding and Husbandry, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel (Germany) and between August 2010 and July 2012 at the Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Animal Husbandry of Bavarian State Research Center for Agriculture in Grub (Germany). The two breeds Holstein Friesian cows (Karkendamm) and Fleckvieh (Grub) were considered in this study. Software for recording, image sorting and evaluation, determining the body parts needed, and extracting traits from the images was written and assembled to an automated system. Sorting the images and finding ischeal tuberosities, base of the tail, and dishes of the rump, backbone, and hips had error rates of 0.2%, 1.5%, 0.1%, and 2.6%, respectively. 13 traits were extracted and compared to backfat thickness and body condition score as well as between breeds. All traits depend significantly on the animal and showed very large effect sizes. Coefficients of determination restricted to individual animals were reaching up to 0.89. The precision in measuring the traits and gathering backfat thickness was comparable. Results indicated that the application of Time-Of-Flight in determination of body traits is feasible.",2014,41,0,10.1186/2193-1801-3-225,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/663649c0c7c595577d178433acb21be6a54f5ced,JournalArticle,SpringerPlus

CRISPR/Cas technology: a revolutionary approach for genome engineering. Precision genome editing tools are invaluable for biology, medicine and agriculture. With these tools we can determine the genetic basis underlying biological traits and processes , and then modify the genome of crops and livestock, model organisms, and even of patients, for phenotypic improvement , disease modeling and treatment. Site-specific nucleases provide a powerful and effective approach for precise genome editing in organisms [1]. Two types of site-specific nucleases, namely zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), have already been widely used for genome engineering. Both of them are composed of two functional modules: the DNA binding domain that is programmable for specific DNA sequence binding, and the Fok1 nuclease domain that can induce double strand breaks. By non-homologous end joining repair, the double strand breaks at target sites can therefore produce sequence insertions and deletions (indels). Recently, a new type of site-specific nu-cleases, the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system, has emerged and raised a revolution in the genomics field. The CRISPR/Cas system is an acquired immune system of many bacteria and archaea, which can identify the alien plasmids or phages and cut them by the Cas protein. Thus by inserting a plasmid containing Cas genes and specifically designed CRISPRs, an organism's genome can be cut at any desired location. Following this idea, the CRISPR/Cas system was first used for genome editing via specific gene silencing in 2012. In 2013, this system was first adapted for genome editing in mammalian cells, which laid the basis for the widely application of this technology [2,3]. In contrast to ZFN and TALEN, gene targeting of the CRISPR/Cas system is mediated by a small RNA, which make it very easy to design and achieve multiplex genome editing. Till now, the CRISPR/Cas system-mediated gene targeting has been successfully applied in many kinds of species, including plants, flies, zebrafish and rodents [4]. Notably, multiple gene knockout mice and rats, which may need more than two years to construct by conventional embryonic stem cell-based method, could be simultaneously generated in nearly one month in one-step by zygote injection of Cas9 RNA and guide RNAs. By the zygote-injection approach, the CRISPR/Cas system has also produced biallelic knockout pigs, demonstrating the feasibility of this technique in large animals [5]. Recently, gene targeting in non-human primates has also been achieved …",2014,32,0,10.1007/s11427-014-4670-x,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/454a74b0f97b717b4605859120cc5002e6c8e1f3,JournalArticle,Science China Life Sciences

Tractor guidance systems for supervised navigation and implement control have reached the market, and prototypes of field robots performing precision agriculture tasks without human intervention also exist. But research in advanced cognitive perception and behaviour that is required to enable a more efficient, reliable and safe autonomy becomes increasingly demanding due to the growing software complexity. A lack of collaboration between research groups contributes to the problem. Scientific publications describe methods and results from the work, but little field robot software is released and documented for others to use. We hypothesize that a common open software platform tailored to field robots in precision agriculture will significantly decrease development time and resources required to perform experiments due to efficient reuse of existing work across projects and robot platforms. In this work we present the FroboMind software platform and evaluate the performance when applied to precision agriculture tasks.",2014,57,3,10.3390/robotics3020207,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e99d954ed649b7340f3bcc05d76a282ad212d2f,JournalArticle,Robotics

Injecting drug users (IDUs) are prone to infections caused by pathogens like hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. Their transmissions are primarily parenteral, which occur through the sharing of contaminated injection equipments. 
 
This study was carried out from August 2007 to October 2007 at the Department of Microbiology, T. N. Medical College and BYL Nair Charitable Hospital, Mumbai, India, after obtaining the approval of the institutional ethics committee. 
 
The sample size and the study design were the same as were followed at NACO identified sentinel sites at Mumbai, for the annual HIV sentinel surveillance round. Two hundred and fifty blood samples were collected by using an outreach strategy. Sample size was determined by the formula, n=Z2 p (1-p)/d2, where n= sample size, z= 1.96 for a 95% confidence limit, p= prevalence rate and d=degree of precision [1]. The target group comprised of first time visitors at the surveillance round, who had injected at least once in the last six months and were identified by a drug de-addiction centre. Testing for anti-HIV antibodies was done by using Microlisa (J.Mitra and Co., New Delhi) and Pareekshak ½ Triline (Bhat Biotec India (P) Ltd. Bangalore, Karnataka), as per strategy II of NACO guidelines. For anti-HCV antibodies, INNOVA HCV ELISA Kit test ( Span Diagnostics, Surat, India ) was used and for HBsAg, ERBA LISA hepatitis B kit (Transasia Biomedicals Ltd. Mumbai, India) was used. The positive samples were confirmed by retesting the respective ELISA tests. 
 
The target population was urban in locale. 76% were non-migrants and 54.4% were illiterate, and only 2.4% were graduates. Most of them were from agricultural background. One hundred and fifteen (46%) of the IDUs were of the age group of 21-29 years [Table/Fig-1]. The male to female ratio was 100: 6.8. The first injecting drug abuse had occurred at the age of 18 years, and the ages of IDUs ranged from 18-67 years [Table/Fig-1]. Fifty Two (20.8%) tested positive for antibodies to HIV 1, 192 (76.8%) were positive for antibodies to HCV and 83(33.2%) were HBsAg positive [Table/Fig-2]. HIV-HCV co-infection was detected in 16% cases (p-value: 0.8536 ), HIV-HBV co-infection was detected in 7.8% cases (p-value : 0.6149) and HIV and HBV co-infection was seen in 7.2% cases (p-value: 0.6149 ). HIV-HBV-HCV co-infection was seen in 6% of the IDUs. Co-infections were not statistically significant [Table/Fig-2,​,33].

20.8% HIV infection seen amongst IDUs was similar to that seen in a previous study [2], though 30% and 59.6% infection had also been reported previously [3-5].Only HIV 1 infection was detected, although there had been reports on HIV 2 infection seen among IDUs in Manipur, India, being a pattern II country for the spread of HIV, the major mode of HIV transmission is heterosexual (70-75%) and therefore, HIV in IDUs quickly spreads to the general population. 
 
33.2% HbsAg reactivity seen in the present study was similar to those seen in studies done in 2000 and 2001, in which the HBsAg positivity in IDUs was found to be 35.3% [6]. Most of the HBV infections occur as a result of sexual activity, intravenous drug use, or occupational exposure. Less common causes include household contact, haemodialysis, and receipt of solid organs or blood products. No clear risk factors were identified in 20% to 30% of infected individuals. 
 
A high HCV reactivity of 76.8% seen in the present study, was similar to 76.9% in Garfein’s study [2]. In a previous study in 2004, 61.2% HCV reactivity was reported from Mumbai [5]. Factors which are associated with HCV mono-infection and HIV-HCV co-infection are: longer durations of injecting drug use, use of multiple injection drugs and sharing injection equipments and containers.",2014,2,0,10.7860/JCDR/2014/7959.4482,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/70166c58f76a465dc9823cd6cb98549c96f20260,JournalArticle,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR

928ac447b6ff35799f0320097a2e3b25d219b797,Exploring Novel Bands and Key Index for Evaluating Leaf Equivalent Water Thickness in Wheat Using Hyperspectra Influenced by Nitrogen,"Leaf equivalent water thickness (LEWT) is an important indicator of crop water status. Effectively monitoring the water status of wheat under different nitrogen treatments is important for effective water management in precision agriculture. Trends in the variation of LEWT in wheat plants during plant growth were analyzed based on field experiments in which wheat plants under various water and nitrogen treatments in two consecutive growing seasons. Two-band spectral indices [normalized difference spectral indices (NDSI), ratio spectral indices (RSI), different spectral indices (DSI)], and then three-band spectral indices were established based on the best two-band spectral index within the range of 350–2500 nm to reduce the noise caused by nitrogen and saturation. Then, optimal spectral indices were selected to construct models of LEWT monitoring in wheat. The results showed that the two-band spectral index NDSI(R1204, R1318) could be used for LEWT monitoring throughout the wheat growth season, but the model performed differently before and after anthesis. Therefore, further two-band spectral indices NDSIb(R1445, R487), NDSIa(R1714, R1395), and NDSI(R1429, R416), were constructed for the two developmental phases, with NDSI(R1429, R416) considered to be the best index. Finally, a three-band index (R1429−R416−R1865)/(R1429+R416+R1865), which was superior for monitoring LEWT and reducing the noise caused by nitrogen, was formed on the best two-band spectral index NDSI(R1429, R416) by adding the 1,865 nm wavelenght as the third band. This produced more uniformity and stable performance compared with the two-band spectral indices in the LEWT model. The results are of technical significance for monitoring the water status of wheat under different nitrogen treatments in precision agriculture.",2014,25,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0096352,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/928ac447b6ff35799f0320097a2e3b25d219b797,JournalArticle,PLoS ONE

Decades of research on the molecular basis of pathogenesis focused on a limited number of factors associated with long-known host-microbe interaction systems, providing limited direction into this challenge. Computational approaches to identify virulence genes often rely on two strategies: searching for sequence similarity to known host-microbe interaction factors from other organisms, and identifying islands of genes that discriminate between pathogens of one type and closely related non-pathogens or pathogens of a different type. The former is limited to known genes, excluding vast collections of genes of unknown function found in every genome. The latter lacks specificity, since many genes in genomic islands have little to do with host-interaction. In this study, we developed a supervised machine learning approach that was designed to recognize patterns from large and disparate data types, in order to identify candidate host-microbe interaction factors. The soft rot Enterobacteriaceae strains Dickeya dadantii 3937 and Pectobacterium carotovorum WPP14 were used for development of this tool, because these pathogens are important on multiple high value crops in agriculture worldwide and more genomic and functional data is available for the Enterobacteriaceae than any other microbial family. Our approach achieved greater than 90% precision and a recall rate over 80% in 10-fold cross validation tests. Application of the learning scheme to the complete genome of these two organisms generated a list of roughly 200 candidates, many of which were previously not implicated in plant-microbe interaction and many of which are of completely unknown function. These lists provide new targets for experimental validation and further characterization, and our approach presents a promising pattern-learning scheme that can be generalized to create a resource to study host-microbe interactions in other bacterial phytopathogens.",2014,11,0,10.1186/1471-2164-15-508,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11be47aaacbc6305a265b55ec358b7ad3c135f45,JournalArticle,BMC Genomics

ae8735942002337318a9e43927dfa2bce1972d32,Locating Anchors in WSN Using a Wearable IMU-Camera,"Localization in a wireless sensor network (WSN) becomes important for many modern applications, like landslide detection, precision agriculture, health care, and so forth. The more precise the position of an anchor node is, the more accurate the localization of a sensor node can be measured. Since the Global Positioning System (GPS) device cannot work properly indoor, some existing localization methods configure anchor nodes in a manual fashion. However, neither applying GPS modules nor manually configuring anchor nodes is suitable for a WSN and especially artificial errors of manual configuration may be propagated and affect the results of localization. In this paper, we propose an alternative method to estimate anchor node locations in an indoor environment. We collect the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data from the anchor node when human is walking around them. Meanwhile, we use a wearable IMU-camera device to assist the moving trajectory estimation. We implement a monocular Visual Odometry with a human walking model to estimate moving trajectories. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is used to estimate the anchor node location by fusing the RSSI data and moving trajectory. The experiment results show that the proposed method has lower estimation error when locating anchors.",2014,2,0,10.1155/2014/654063,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae8735942002337318a9e43927dfa2bce1972d32,JournalArticle,Int.

9eace7f585bec77f0713b7619abd6f7b040f0c20,Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Patterns and Transcription Analysis in Sheep Muscle,"DNA methylation plays a central role in regulating many aspects of growth and development in mammals through regulating gene expression. The development of next generation sequencing technologies have paved the way for genome-wide, high resolution analysis of DNA methylation landscapes using methodology known as reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). While RRBS has proven to be effective in understanding DNA methylation landscapes in humans, mice, and rats, to date, few studies have utilised this powerful method for investigating DNA methylation in agricultural animals. Here we describe the utilisation of RRBS to investigate DNA methylation in sheep Longissimus dorsi muscles. RRBS analysis of ∼1% of the genome from Longissimus dorsi muscles provided data of suitably high precision and accuracy for DNA methylation analysis, at all levels of resolution from genome-wide to individual nucleotides. Combining RRBS data with mRNAseq data allowed the sheep Longissimus dorsi muscle methylome to be compared with methylomes from other species. While some species differences were identified, many similarities were observed between DNA methylation patterns in sheep and other more commonly studied species. The RRBS data presented here highlights the complexity of epigenetic regulation of genes. However, the similarities observed across species are promising, in that knowledge gained from epigenetic studies in human and mice may be applied, with caution, to agricultural species. The ability to accurately measure DNA methylation in agricultural animals will contribute an additional layer of information to the genetic analyses currently being used to maximise production gains in these species.",2014,36,2,10.1371/journal.pone.0101853,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9eace7f585bec77f0713b7619abd6f7b040f0c20,JournalArticle,PLoS ONE

71782211e4d474ed19fb120b9a1518c854fb4570,Granular impact cratering by liquid drops: Understanding raindrop imprints through an analogy to asteroid strikes,"Significance We provide a quantitative understanding of raindrop impacts on sandy surfaces—a ubiquitous phenomenon relevant to many important natural, agricultural, and industrial processes. Combining high-speed photography with high-precision laser profilometry, we investigate the dynamics of liquid-drop impacts on granular surfaces and monitor the morphology of resulting impact craters. Remarkably, we discover a quantitative similarity between liquid-drop impacts and asteroid strikes in terms of both the energy scaling and the aspect ratio of their impact craters. Such a similarity inspires us to apply the idea developed in planetary sciences to liquid-drop impact cratering, which leads to a model that quantitatively describes various features of liquid-drop imprints. When a granular material is impacted by a sphere, its surface deforms like a liquid yet it preserves a circular crater like a solid. Although the mechanism of granular impact cratering by solid spheres is well explored, our knowledge on granular impact cratering by liquid drops is still very limited. Here, by combining high-speed photography with high-precision laser profilometry, we investigate liquid-drop impact dynamics on granular surface and monitor the morphology of resulting impact craters. Surprisingly, we find that despite the enormous energy and length difference, granular impact cratering by liquid drops follows the same energy scaling and reproduces the same crater morphology as that of asteroid impact craters. Inspired by this similarity, we integrate the physical insight from planetary sciences, the liquid marble model from fluid mechanics, and the concept of jamming transition from granular physics into a simple theoretical framework that quantitatively describes all of the main features of liquid-drop imprints in granular media. Our study sheds light on the mechanisms governing raindrop impacts on granular surfaces and reveals a remarkable analogy between familiar phenomena of raining and catastrophic asteroid strikes.",2014,80,3,10.1073/pnas.1419271112,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/71782211e4d474ed19fb120b9a1518c854fb4570,JournalArticle,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
d12a947048e9b4ea02db57a34c410a4295e73496,Epilepsy Treatment Simplified through Mobile Ketogenic Diet Planning.,"BACKGROUND
The Ketogenic Diet (KD) is an effective, alternative treatment for refractory epilepsy. This high fat, low protein and carbohydrate diet mimics the metabolic and hormonal changes that are associated with fasting.


AIMS
To maximize the effectiveness of the KD, each meal is precisely planned, calculated, and weighed to within 0.1 gram for the average three-year duration of treatment. Managing the KD is time-consuming and may deter caretakers and patients from pursuing or continuing this treatment. Thus, we investigated methods of planning KD faster and making the process more portable through mobile applications.


METHODS
Nutritional data was gathered from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Nutrient Database. User selected foods are converted into linear equations with n variables and three constraints: prescribed fat content, prescribed protein content, and prescribed carbohydrate content. Techniques are applied to derive the solutions to the underdetermined system depending on the number of foods chosen.


RESULTS
The method was implemented on an iOS device and tested with varieties of foods and different number of foods selected. With each case, the application's constructed meal plan was within 95% precision of the KD requirements.


CONCLUSION
In this study, we attempt to reduce the time needed to calculate a meal by automating the computation of the KD via a linear algebra model. We improve upon previous KD calculators by offering optimal suggestions and incorporating the USDA database. We believe this mobile application will help make the KD and other dietary treatment preparations less time consuming and more convenient.",2014,5,0,10.7309/jmtm.3.2.3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d12a947048e9b4ea02db57a34c410a4295e73496,JournalArticle,Journal of Mobile Technology in Medicine

57b95438eebccf306a10f9ac35744b6534661b06,Innovative analysis and use of high‐resolution DTMs for quantitative interrogation of Earth‐surface processes,"This is the era of digital landscapes; the widespread availability of powerful sensing technologies has revolutionized the way it is possible to interrogate landscapes in order to understand the processes sculpting them. Vastly greater areas have now been acquired at ‘high resolution’: currently tens of metres globally to millimetric precision and accuracy locally. This permits geomorphic features to be visualized and analysed across the scales at which Earth‐surface processes operate. Especially exciting is the capturing of process dynamics in repeated surveying, which will only become more important with low‐cost accessible data generation through techniques such as Structure from Motion (SfM). But the key challenge remains; to interpret high resolution Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), particularly by extracting geomorphic features in robust and objective ways and then linking the observed features to the underlying physical processes. In response to the new data and challenges, recent years have seen improved processing of raw data into DTMs, development of data fusion techniques, novel quantitative analysis of topographic data, and innovative geomorphological mapping. The twelve papers collected in this volume sample this progress in interrogating Earth‐surface processes through the analysis of DTMs. They cover a wide range of disciplines and spatio‐temporal scales, from landslide prone landscapes, to agriculturally modified regions, to mountainous landscapes, and coastal zones. They all, however, showcase the quantitative exploitation of information contained in high‐resolution topographic data that we believe will underpin the improvement of our understanding of many elements of Earth‐surface processes. Most of the papers introduced here were first presented in a conference session at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in 2011.

756b820ae3cd083f8f67e0b1cc59661a838cf8e3,Nanotechnology in agriculture: prospects and constraints,"Attempts to apply nanotechnology in agriculture began with the growing realization that conventional farming technologies would neither be able to increase productivity any further nor restore ecosystems damaged by existing technologies back to their pristine state; in particular because the long-term effects of farming with “miracle seeds”, in conjunction with irrigation, fertilizers, and pesticides, have been questioned both at the scientific and policy levels, and must be gradually phased out. Nanotechnology in agriculture has gained momentum in the last decade with an abundance of public funding, but the pace of development is modest, even though many disciplines come under the umbrella of agriculture. This could be attributed to: a unique nature of farm production, which functions as an open system whereby energy and matter are exchanged freely; the scale of demand of input materials always being gigantic in contrast with industrial nanoproducts; an absence of control over the input nanomaterials in contrast with industrial nanoproducts (eg, the cell phone) and because their fate has to be conceived on the geosphere (pedosphere)-biosphere-hydrosphere-atmosphere continuum; the time lag of emerging technologies reaching the farmers’ field, especially given that many emerging economies are unwilling to spend on innovation; and the lack of foresight resulting from agricultural education not having attracted a sufficient number of brilliant minds the world over, while personnel from kindred disciplines might lack an understanding of agricultural production systems. If these issues are taken care of, nanotechnologic intervention in farming has bright prospects for improving the efficiency of nutrient use through nanoformulations of fertilizers, breaking yield barriers through bionanotechnology, surveillance and control of pests and diseases, understanding mechanisms of host-parasite interactions at the molecular level, development of new-generation pesticides and their carriers, preservation and packaging of food and food additives, strengthening of natural fibers, removal of contaminants from soil and water, improving the shelf-life of vegetables and flowers, clay-based nanoresources for precision water management, reclamation of salt-affected soils, and stabilization of erosion-prone surfaces, to name a few.",2014,330,6,10.2147/NSA.S39409,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/756b820ae3cd083f8f67e0b1cc59661a838cf8e3,"Review,JournalArticle","Nanotechnology, Science and Applications"

5c61143c825b82373e368e66ba16ff51df2bb455,Digital Mapping of Soil Organic Carbon Contents and Stocks in Denmark,"Estimation of carbon contents and stocks are important for carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions and national carbon balance inventories. For Denmark, we modeled the vertical distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and bulk density, and mapped its spatial distribution at five standard soil depth intervals (0−5, 5−15, 15−30, 30−60 and 60−100 cm) using 18 environmental variables as predictors. SOC distribution was influenced by precipitation, land use, soil type, wetland, elevation, wetness index, and multi-resolution index of valley bottom flatness. The highest average SOC content of 20 g kg−1 was reported for 0−5 cm soil, whereas there was on average 2.2 g SOC kg−1 at 60−100 cm depth. For SOC and bulk density prediction precision decreased with soil depth, and a standard error of 2.8 g kg−1 was found at 60−100 cm soil depth. Average SOC stock for 0−30 cm was 72 t ha−1 and in the top 1 m there was 120 t SOC ha−1. In total, the soils stored approximately 570 Tg C within the top 1 m. The soils under agriculture had the highest amount of carbon (444 Tg) followed by forest and semi-natural vegetation that contributed 11% of the total SOC stock. More than 60% of the total SOC stock was present in Podzols and Luvisols. Compared to previous estimates, our approach is more reliable as we adopted a robust quantification technique and mapped the spatial distribution of SOC stock and prediction uncertainty. The estimation was validated using common statistical indices and the data and high-resolution maps could be used for future soil carbon assessment and inventories.",2014,294,10,10.1371/journal.pone.0105519,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c61143c825b82373e368e66ba16ff51df2bb455,JournalArticle,PLoS ONE

72c2a39bb3ecec58309d94e40644c6acaf9ec0da,The Neolithic Demographic Transition in Europe: Correlation with Juvenility Index Supports Interpretation of the Summed Calibrated Radiocarbon Date Probability Distribution (SCDPD) as a Valid Demographic Proxy,"Analysis of the proportion of immature skeletons recovered from European prehistoric cemeteries has shown that the transition to agriculture after 9000 BP triggered a long-term increase in human fertility. Here we compare the largest analysis of European cemeteries to date with an independent line of evidence, the summed calibrated date probability distribution of radiocarbon dates (SCDPD) from archaeological sites. Our cemetery reanalysis confirms increased growth rates after the introduction of agriculture; the radiocarbon analysis also shows this pattern, and a significant correlation between both lines of evidence confirms the demographic validity of SCDPDs. We analyze the areal extent of Neolithic enclosures and demographic data from ethnographically known farming and foraging societies and we estimate differences in population levels at individual sites. We find little effect on the overall shape and precision of the SCDPD and we observe a small increase in the correlation with the cemetery trends. The SCDPD analysis supports the hypothesis that the transition to agriculture dramatically increased demographic growth, but it was followed within centuries by a general pattern of collapse even after accounting for higher settlement densities during the Neolithic. The study supports the unique contribution of SCDPDs as a valid demographic proxy for the demographic patterns associated with early agriculture.",2014,85,4,10.1371/journal.pone.0105730,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72c2a39bb3ecec58309d94e40644c6acaf9ec0da,JournalArticle,PLoS ONE

835dfe785faec03f47ec0266fcc49715c396add0,Terrestrial laser scanning for plant height measurement and biomass estimation of maize,"Over the last decades, the role of remote sensing gained in importance for monitoring applications in precision agriculture. A key factor for assessing the development of crops during the growing period is the actual biomass. As non-destructive methods of directly measuring biomass do not exist, parameters like plant height are considered as estimators. In this contribution, first results of multitemporal surveys on a maize field with a terrestrial laser scanner are shown. The achieved point clouds are interpolated to generate Crop Surface Models (CSM) that represent the top canopy. These CSMs are used for visualizing the spatial distribution of plant height differences within the field and calculating plant height above ground with a high resolution of 1 cm. In addition, manual measurements of plant height were carried out corresponding to each TLS campaign to verify the results. The high coefficient of determination (R² = 0.93) between both measurement methods shows the applicability of the presented approach. The established regression model between CSM-derived plant height and destructively measured biomass shows a varying performance depending on the considered time frame during the growing period. This study shows that TLS is a suitable and promising method for measuring plant height of maize. Moreover, it shows the potential of plant height as a non-destructive estimator for biomass in the early growing period. However, challenges are the non-linear development of plant height and biomass over the whole growing period.",2014,20,1,10.5194/ISPRSARCHIVES-XL-7-181-2014,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/835dfe785faec03f47ec0266fcc49715c396add0,Review,

cd5c6ef21355b24d2c8d64c15318a5ca89c3ffa7,Introduction and preliminary results of a calibration for full-frame hyperspectral cameras to monitor agricultural crops with UAVs,Abstract. Hyperspectral remote sensing helps to acquire information about the status of agricultural crops to allow optimized management practices in the context of precision agriculture. Due to technological innovations small and lightweight hyperspectral sensors have become available which may be carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this paper we give a brief overview over existing hyperspectral sensors for UAVs. We focus on a new type of full-frame sensors which capture hyperspectral information in two dimensional image frames. We then develop a calibration procedure for these sensors and identify challenges in remote sensing of vegetation. The calibration is evaluate by in-field data acquired during a flight campaign. The spectral calibration shows good results with less than three percent difference in reflection for 110 of the 125 bands (458 to 886 nm).,2014,26,0,10.5194/ISPRSARCHIVES-XL-7-1-2014,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cd5c6ef21355b24d2c8d64c15318a5ca89c3ffa7,Review,

db5e43f39b32eb377cbbaba301a343d30326539d,A Novel Low-Cost Open-Hardware Platform for Monitoring Soil Water Content and Multiple Soil-Air-Vegetation Parameters,"Monitoring soil water content at high spatio-temporal resolution and coupled to other sensor data is crucial for applications oriented towards water sustainability in agriculture, such as precision irrigation or phenotyping root traits for drought tolerance. The cost of instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost “open hardware” platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 < 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks. This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach whereby sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies.",2014,92,4,10.3390/s141019639,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db5e43f39b32eb377cbbaba301a343d30326539d,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

Estimating above-ground biomass helps to monitor crop vitality and to predict yield. In this study, we estimated fresh and dry biomass on a summer barley test site with 18 cultivars and two nitrogen (N)-treatments using the plant height (PH) from crop surface models (CSMs). The super-high resolution, multi-temporal (1 cm/pixel) CSMs were derived from red, green, blue (RGB) images captured from a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Comparison with PH reference measurements yielded an R2 of 0.92. The test site with different cultivars and treatments was monitored during “Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie” (BBCH) Stages 24–89. A high correlation was found between PH from CSMs and fresh biomass (R2 = 0.81) and dry biomass (R2 = 0.82). Five models for above-ground fresh and dry biomass estimation were tested by cross-validation. Modelling biomass between different N-treatments for fresh biomass produced the best results (R2 = 0.71). The main limitation was the influence of lodging cultivars in the later growth stages, producing irregular plant heights. The method has potential for future application by non-professionals, i.e., farmers.",2014,600,35,10.3390/rs61110395,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b22697902076b38ce9440e01d05753e30d2a9cbb,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing
d97da99092451837ceddbdd4a8905d7dc7a1b2f7,Estimation of Nitrogen Vertical Distribution by Bi-Directional Canopy Reflectance in Winter Wheat,"Timely measurement of vertical foliage nitrogen distribution is critical for increasing crop yield and reducing environmental impact. In this study, a novel method with partial least square regression (PLSR) and vegetation indices was developed to determine optimal models for extracting vertical foliage nitrogen distribution of winter wheat by using bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data. The BRDF data were collected from ground-based hyperspectral reflectance measurements recorded at the Xiaotangshan Precision Agriculture Experimental Base in 2003, 2004 and 2007. The view zenith angles (1) at nadir, 40° and 50°; (2) at nadir, 30° and 40°; and (3) at nadir, 20° and 30° were selected as optical view angles to estimate foliage nitrogen density (FND) at an upper, middle and bottom layer, respectively. For each layer, three optimal PLSR analysis models with FND as a dependent variable and two vegetation indices (nitrogen reflectance index (NRI), normalized pigment chlorophyll index (NPCI) or a combination of NRI and NPCI) at corresponding angles as explanatory variables were established. The experimental results from an independent model verification demonstrated that the PLSR analysis models with the combination of NRI and NPCI as the explanatory variables were the most accurate in estimating FND for each layer. The coefficients of determination (R2) of this model between upper layer-, middle layer- and bottom layer-derived and laboratory-measured foliage nitrogen density were 0.7335, 0.7336, 0.6746, respectively.",2014,40,3,10.3390/s141120347,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d97da99092451837ceddbdd4a8905d7dc7a1b2f7,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors
c3e39b65854aa6c442b0fdee4d6f3b746ef7b464,The use of soil electrical resistivity to monitor plant and soil water relationships in vineyards.,"Abstract. Soil water availability deeply affects plant physiology. In viticulture it is considered a major contributor to the ""terroir"" effect. The assessment of soil water in field conditions is a difficult task, especially over large surfaces. New techniques are therefore required in order to better explore variations of soil water content in space and time with low disturbance and with great precision. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) meets these requirements for applications in plant sciences, agriculture and ecology. In this paper, possible techniques to develop models that allow the use of ERT to spatialise soil water available to plants are reviewed. An application of soil water monitoring using ERT in a grapevine plot in Burgundy (north-east France) during the vintage 2013 is presented. We observed the lateral heterogeneity of ERT-derived fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) variations, and differences in water uptake depend on grapevine water status (leaf water potentials measured both at predawn and at solar noon and contemporary to ERT monitoring). Active zones in soils for water movements were identified. The use of ERT in ecophysiological studies, with parallel monitoring of plant water status, is still rare. These methods are promising because they have the potential to reveal a hidden part of a major function of plant development: the capacity to extract water from the soil.",2014,77,3,10.5194/SOIL-1-273-2015,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c3e39b65854aa6c442b0fdee4d6f3b746ef7b464,Review,

However, only a few scientists have reported using LARS to monitor crop conditions. Moreover, there have been concerns regarding the feasibility of such systems for producers given the issues related to the post-processing of images, technical expertise, and timely delivery of information. The purpose of this study is to showcase actual requests by farmers to monitor crop conditions in their fields using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Working in collaboration with farmers in northeastern Ontario, we use optical and near-infrared imagery to monitor fertilizer trials, conduct crop scouting and map field tile drainage. We demonstrate that LARS imagery has many practical applications. However, several obstacles remain, including the costs associated with both the LARS system and the image processing software, the extent of professional training required to operate the LARS and to process the imagery, and the influence from local weather conditions (e.g. clouds, wind) on image acquisition all need to be considered. Consequently, at present a feasible solution for producers might be the use of LARS service provided by private consultants or in collaboration with LARS scientific research teams.",2014,84,3,10.1371/journal.pone.0112894,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/54bfa0262849175a85a0b5bcda25992c42d622f0,JournalArticle,PLoS ONE

03e9a197a2803da5b9d2423dcf4ccdc37fb05cd2,Farmers’ Perception of Precision Farming Technology among Hungarian Farmers,"Many technologies have appeared in agriculture to reduce the harmful effects of chemical use. One of these technologies is precision farming technology. Precision farming technology should not be considered as only the latest plant production technology or only a new agro-management tool. It is achieved only when the results of electronics and IT equipment are realized in the variable rate treatments zone-by-zone. The advantages and disadvantages of this technology highly depend on the heterogeneity of soil, the knowledge and attitude of the manager and the staff. This is the reason why opinions about the technology effects are so wide. This paper shows the results of the investigation based on interviews about the adoption and knowledge of precision farming technology among Hungarian crop producers. This technology is mostly used by farms over 300 hectares with young farmers. The most characteristic elements were precision fertilization and tractor guidance. The survey examined three groups of farmers with respect to whether they apply precision farming elements or not. We refer to them as “users”, “planners” and “non-users”. According to the survey, the opinions of the “user” and the “non-user” groups of farmers are not significantly different regarding the impacts of precision farming technology (the main advantages were the change in yield quantity, chemical usage and income). Furthermore, the opinions of the farmers regarding the changes in variable costs resulting from the adoption of precision farming technology were also examined (measured in percent). Box-plot analysis was used for this examination. According to the opinion of the “user” group of farmers, the highest cost savings occurred in fertilizer and herbicide costs.",2014,52,1,10.3390/SU6128452,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03e9a197a2803da5b9d2423dcf4ccdc37fb05cd2,Review,

95fa6b68ca6669e29c0e965599d884d499063dc9,Forest nutrition and fertilization in teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) plantations in Central America†,"BackgroundSoil fertility management and forest nutrition are key factors determining management and productivity of both natural and planted forests. Reference values for foliar and soil nutrient contents and assessment of nutrient balances to evaluate the sustainability of planted forest systems can guide forest managers in determining whether or not additional fertilisation is required.MethodsThis review summarises the authors' research into the nutritional requirements for planted teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) forests in Central and South America. Teak is an important species for commercial forest plantations, usually in carefully selected productive sites, with rotations of 20-25 years and commercial volume anticipated to be around 10 m3 ha-1 year-1.ResultsFoliar nutrient concentration values can be used as a reference to evaluate the nutritional status of planted teak forests. In addition, there may be an association between the dynamics of the concentrations of K, Mg and N with tree age and the age-related declines in teak productivity. Timber extraction by felling constitutes a major nutrient output from the system and repeated nutrient exports during several rotations could be a cause of soil nutrients depletion, especially P and K which typically have low availability in these Central American systems. Multivariate analyses have been shown to be appropriate and helpful tools for grouping forest stands by fertility classes (i.e. soil management zones using the terminology of precision agriculture).ConclusionsThe techniques developed can be used as tools for the design of efficient fertilisation programmes, taking into account the inherent heterogeneity of soil fertility across different stands. This is considered as a first step towards a precision forestry scheme. Whether age-related changes in nutrient concentrations are a cause or a consequence of age-related declines in productivity is an important issue for future research.",2014,19,2,10.1186/1179-5395-44-S1-S6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/95fa6b68ca6669e29c0e965599d884d499063dc9,Review,New Zealand Journal of Forestry Science
d392e3a35c905899e27e20d4acaaac0aab4ac07f,The Omega-3 Fatty Acid Docosahexaenoic Acid Attenuates Organic Dust-Induced Airway Inflammation,"Workers exposed to organic dusts from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are at risk for developing airway inflammatory diseases. Available preventative and therapeutic measures for alleviating dust-induced lung disease are inadequate. Because omega-3 fatty acids can mitigate inflammatory processes, we aimed to determine whether nutritional supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could reduce the airway inflammatory consequences of exposures to organic dust. Aqueous extracts of organic dusts from swine CAFOs (ODE) were utilized. In DHA-pretreated human bronchial epithelial cells, lung fibroblasts, monocyte cell cultures, and precision-cut murine lung slices, we found that DHA pretreatment dose-dependently decreased ODE-induced inflammatory cytokine production. To determine the in vivo significance of DHA, C57BL/6 mice were orally administered DHA for seven days prior to treatment with intranasal ODE or saline inhalations. Animals treated with 2 mg DHA demonstrated significant reductions in ODE-induced bronchial alveolar lavage neutrophil influx and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production compared to mice exposed to ODE alone. Collectively, these data demonstrate that DHA affects several lung cells to reduce the airway inflammatory response to organic dust exposures. Dietary supplementation with DHA may be an effective therapeutic strategy to reduce the airway inflammatory consequences in individuals exposed to agriculture dust environments.",2014,36,0,10.3390/nu6125434,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d392e3a35c905899e27e20d4acaaac0aab4ac07f,JournalArticle,Nutrients

This study contributes to the improvement of 3D geodata capturing efficiency by assessing the effect of reduced scanning resolution on crop surface models (CSMs). The analysis is based on high-end LiDAR point clouds of grain crop fields of different varieties (rye and wheat) and nitrogen fertilization stages (100%, 50%, 10%). Lower scanning resolutions are simulated by keeping every n-th laser beam with increasing step widths n. For each iteration step, high-resolution CSMs (0.01 m2 cells) are derived and assessed regarding their coverage relative to a seamless CSM derived from the original point cloud, standard deviation of elevation and mean elevation. Reducing the resolution to, e.g., 25% still leads to a coverage of >90% and a mean CSM elevation of >96% of measured crop height. CSM types (maximum elevation or 90th-percentile elevation) react differently to reduced scanning resolutions in different crops (variety, density). The results can help to assess the trade-off between CSM quality and minimum requirements regarding equipment and capturing set-up.",2014,51,3,10.3390/s141224212,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/24b2b82ad64769b67d62802c1f223d546979a125,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

Thus, this study aimed to characterize the concept of specific soil management zone by using spatial correlations and ordinary cokriging between Valencia orange yield and soil attributes, aiming to select the soil attribute that is more efficiently related to the increase in yield, in a geostatistical grid with 120 sampling points, in 1.65 ha. The soil attributes surveyed were: P, OM, pH, K + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , H + +Al 3+ , S, T and V%. The data were submitted to descriptive analysis, Pearson’s correlations end geostatistical analysis. Thus, the orange yield resulted in significant ordinary cokrigings, for both the pH and soil Mg content evaluated. This technique allowed the creation of two specific zones of soil pH management closely associated to that yield. The obtaining of two specific management zones ratified the importance of precision agriculture, concerning the increased orange yield, because by keeping the two specific management zones obtained, the global yield of the area would be 16.91 t ha -1 . However, by providing optimal conditions of soil pH to the one with the highest acidity level, it would be possible to obtain an increase of 7.58 t ha -1 in fruit yield, reaching the global average of 24.49 t ha -1 .",2014,14,1,10.1590/S1983-40632014000400001,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a4553b02c0301a90d35fb2112fa0ac0ac3bd7dd9,Review,

Early forms of precision agriculture involved creating fertilizer maps, yield measurements, grid sampling, and soil pH content monitoring. Roughly 25 years ago, the advent of global positioning systems, commonly known as GPS, enabled farmers to make more informed decisions about where to plant seed and how much seed to plant. Precision agriculture technologies typically utilize sensors that are placed on tractors, combines, and other farm equipment, and which measure various conditions including seeding rates, soil conditions, and other indicators of production. Over time, this technology has been expanded to provide a wide range of services like field mapping, tractor guidance, and yield monitoring. These technologies also help farmers make the most efficient use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. As a result, farmers are no longer forced to treat fields uniformly or to make guesses about the best courses of action for their fields. Instead, precision agriculture enables farmers to micromanage their fields on a day-to day basis, or even minute-by-minute basis, while relying on highly accurate data.",2015,1,0,10.54119/jflp.mxzq7128,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3ea9bdb14b55fa511c3decaa1ed57f1c1cca47ad,JournalArticle,Journal of Food Law &amp; Policy

Until recently, this has only been possible through traditional breeding and selection, which is a painstakingly slow process of accumulating incremental gains over a long period. The development of transgenic livestock technology offers a more direct approach with the possibility for making genetic improvements with greater impact and within a single generation. However, initially the technology was hampered by technical difficulties and limitations, which have now largely been overcome by progressive improvements over the past 30 years. Particularly, the advent of genome editing in combination with homologous recombination has added a new level of efficiency and precision that holds much promise for the genetic improvement of livestock using the increasing knowledge of the phenotypic impact of genetic sequence variants. So far not a single line of transgenic livestock has gained approval for commercialization. The step change to genome‐edited livestock with precise sequence changes may accelerate the path to market, provided applications of this new technology for agriculture can deliver, in addition to economic incentives for producers, also compelling benefits for animals, consumers, and the environment.",2015,89,2,10.1002/biot.201400193,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/98c5a8e91712d44f68fe82448c0f3883a526ecaf,"Review,JournalArticle",Biotechnology Journal

bdfce71eef5b463efa52ab193a78ca26b7a2df0c,"Technological developments for spatial prediction of soil properties, and Danie Krige's influence on it","Synopsis Daniel Krige’s influence on soil science, and on soil survey in particular, has been profound. From the 1920s onwards soil surveyors made their maps by classifying the soils and drawing boundaries between the classes they recognized. By the 1960s many influential pedologists were convinced that if one knew to which class of soil a site belonged then one would be able to predict the soil’s properties there. At the same time, engineers began to realize that prediction from such maps was essentially a statistical matter and to apply classical sampling theory. Such methods, though sound, proved inefficient because they failed to take account of the spatial dependence within the classes. Matters changed dramatically in the 1970s when soil scientists learned of the work of Daniel Krige and Georges Matheron’s theory of regionalized variables. Statistical pedologists (pedometricians) first linked R.A. Fisher’s analysis of variance to regionalized variables via spatial hierarchical designs to estimate spatial components of variance. They then applied the mainstream geostatistical methods of spatial analysis and kriging to map plant nutrients, trace elements, pollutants, salt, and agricultural pests in soil, which has led to advances in modern precision agriculture. They were among the first Earth scientists to use nonlinear statistical estimation for modelling variograms and to make the programmed algorithms publicly available. More recently, pedometricians have turned to likelihood methods, specifically residual maximum likelihood (REML), to combine fixed effects, such as trend and external variables, with spatially correlated variables in linear mixed models for spatial prediction. They have also explored nonstationary variances with wavelets and by spectral tempering, although it is not clear how the results should be used for prediction. This paper illustrates the most significant advances, with results from research projects.",2015,9,0,10.17159/2411-9717/2015/v115n2a12,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bdfce71eef5b463efa52ab193a78ca26b7a2df0c,Review,

This study was conducted in the Qixing Farm County of the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. First, the rice cultivation areas were identified by integrating the remote sensing (RS) classification maps from three dates and the Geographic Information System (GIS) data obtained from a local agency. Specifically, three FORMOSAT-2 (FS-2) images captured during the growing season in 2009 and a GIS topographic map were combined using a knowledge-based classification method. A highly accurate classification map (overall accuracy = 91.6%) was generated based on this Multi-Data-Approach (MDA). Secondly, measured agronomic variables that include biomass, leaf area index (LAI), plant nitrogen (N) concentration and plant N uptake were correlated with the date-specific FS-2 image spectra using stepwise multiple linear regression models. The best model validation results with a relative error (RE) of 8.9% were found in the biomass regression model at the phenological stage of heading. The best index of agreement (IA) value of 0.85 with an RE of 13.6% was found in the LAI model, also at the heading stage. For plant N uptake estimation, the most accurate model was again achieved at the heading stage with an RE of 11% and an IA value of 0.77; however, for plant N concentration estimation, the model performance was best at the booting stage. Finally, the regression models were applied to the identified rice areas to map the within-field variability of the four agronomic variables at different growth stages for the Qixing Farm County. The results provide detailed spatial information on the within-field variability on a regional scale, which is critical for effective field management in precision agriculture.",2015,26,1,10.3390/ijgi4010236,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00caccb574efbb58f56a6fbbc5b45dd6e93e9a60,JournalArticle,ISPRS Int.

Exposure through consumption of contaminated food and feed has deleterious effects on human and animal health. Therefore, aflatoxin contaminated products are a barrier to international trade of agricultural commodities. Not all fungi from Aspergillus section Flavi produce aflatoxins. Hence it is important to differentiate Aspergillus spp. into toxigenic and atoxigenic species to better understand their population structure in a specific environment. A range of methods are available today, including cultural, analytical and molecular methods, to identify the toxin producing ability of isolates from section Flavi. A comprehensive review of these methods would be of great use for researchers in developing nations where fully equipped aflatoxin detection laboratories are lacking. In this paper we critically reviewed the cultural and molecular methods of detecting aflatoxigenic Aspergillus species and their precision.

Data of a German case-control study were supplemented by job descriptions (indicated by ISCO-88). It was examined whether the demands in the various occupational groups modify the effect of noise. Noise and occupational groups are combined to form new exposure categories. Conditional logistic regression models were fitted to identify effects of combined job-noise categories. For the highest noise range (95-124 dB(A)) we found a significant odds-ratio (OR) of 2.18 (confidence interval [CI] 0.95 = 1.17-4.05) independent of the profession. Some interesting results were found indicating ISCO groups with possible risk. In men, noticeable effects for the exposure category between 62 dB(A) and 84 dB(A) are calculated in the group of legislators and senior officials (ISCO-group 11; OR=1.93; CI 0.95 = 0.50-7.42), the group consisting of life science and health professionals (ISCO-group 22; OR=2.18; CI 0.95 = 0.36-13.1), the group of life science and health associate professionals (ISCO-group 32; OR = 2.03; CI 0.95 = 0.50-8.24), and the group of ""precision, handicraft, printing, and related trades workers"" (ISCO-group 73; OR = 2.67; CI 0.95 = 0.54-13.0).

de272d10c96f0912bcfe1625c4e7df4d95ea1f17,An Approach to Precise Nitrogen Management Using Hand-Held Crop Sensor Measurements and Winter Wheat Yield Mapping in a Mediterranean Environment,"Regardless of the crop production system, nutrients inputs must be controlled at or below a certain economic threshold to achieve an acceptable level of profitability. The use of management zones and variable-rate fertilizer applications is gaining popularity in precision agriculture. Many researchers have evaluated the application of final yield maps and geo-referenced geophysical measurements (e.g., apparent soil electrical conductivity-ECa) as a method of establishing relatively homogeneous management zones within the same plot. Yield estimation models based on crop conditions at certain growth stages, soil nutrient statuses, agronomic factors, moisture statuses, and weed/pest pressures are a primary goal in precision agriculture. This study attempted to achieve the following objectives: (1) to investigate the potential for predicting winter wheat yields using vegetation measurements (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index—NDVI) at the beginning of the season, thereby allowing for a yield response to nitrogen (N) fertilizer; and (2) evaluate the feasibility of using inexpensive optical sensor measurements in a Mediterranean environment. A field experiment was conducted in two commercial wheat fields near Seville, in southwestern Spain. Yield data were collected at harvest using a yield monitoring system (RDS Ceres II-volumetric meter) installed on a combine. Wheat yield and NDVI values of 3498 ± 481 kg ha−1 and 0.67 ± 0.04 nm nm−1 (field 1) and 3221 ± 531 kg ha−1 and 0.68 ± 0.05 nm nm−1 (field 2) were obtained. In both fields, the yield and NDVI exhibited a strong Pearson correlation, with rxy = 0.64 and p < 10−4 in field 1 and rxy = 0.78 and p < 10−4 in field 2. The preliminary results indicate that hand-held crop sensor-based N management can be applied to wheat production in Spain and has the potential to increase agronomic N-use efficiency on a long-term basis.",2015,31,1,10.3390/s150305504,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/de272d10c96f0912bcfe1625c4e7df4d95ea1f17,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

50521719dc4b1c0b67a8b4fc12a3cdb19c339c8d,Importance of Genetic Diversity Assessment in Crop Plants and Its Recent Advances: An Overview of Its Analytical Perspectives,"The importance of plant genetic diversity (PGD) is now being recognized as a specific area since exploding population with urbanization and decreasing cultivable lands are the critical factors contributing to food insecurity in developing world. Agricultural scientists realized that PGD can be captured and stored in the form of plant genetic resources (PGR) such as gene bank, DNA library, and so forth, in the biorepository which preserve genetic material for long period. However, conserved PGR must be utilized for crop improvement in order to meet future global challenges in relation to food and nutritional security. This paper comprehensively reviews four important areas; (i) the significance of plant genetic diversity (PGD) and PGR especially on agriculturally important crops (mostly field crops); (ii) risk associated with narrowing the genetic base of current commercial cultivars and climate change; (iii) analysis of existing PGD analytical methods in pregenomic and genomic era; and (iv) modern tools available for PGD analysis in postgenomic era. This discussion benefits the plant scientist community in order to use the new methods and technology for better and rapid assessment, for utilization of germplasm from gene banks to their applied breeding programs. With the advent of new biotechnological techniques, this process of genetic manipulation is now being accelerated and carried out with more precision (neglecting environmental effects) and fast-track manner than the classical breeding techniques. It is also to note that gene banks look into several issues in order to improve levels of germplasm distribution and its utilization, duplication of plant identity, and access to database, for prebreeding activities. Since plant breeding research and cultivar development are integral components of improving food production, therefore, availability of and access to diverse genetic sources will ensure that the global food production network becomes more sustainable. The pros and cons of the basic and advanced statistical tools available for measuring genetic diversity are briefly discussed and their source links (mostly) were provided to get easy access; thus, it improves the understanding of tools and its practical applicability to the researchers.",2015,821,30,10.1155/2015/431487,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50521719dc4b1c0b67a8b4fc12a3cdb19c339c8d,"Review,JournalArticle",Genetics Research International

73adbf2847e6ac495caef07420eb9408d203d577,Performance evaluation of laser guided leveler,"The study was conducted at Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) farm on clay loam soil during Rabi season of 2010-2011. The treatments consisted of laser land leveling (T 1 ) and control (non-leveled) (T 2 ). A preliminary field survey was done using staff gage. Initially a base station was established to dispense laser ray uniformly. The laser ray erected from base station guided the sensor of the stuff gage and the leveler. Elevation data was collected from the different points of the field and made an average. The maximum gage reading were 247.0 cm and the minimum gage reading was 219.2 cm. Average gage readings of the laser leveled plot was 235.66 cm that was settled for auto adjustment. Therefore, huge amount of soils (16.46 cm high) was cut from the highest point and subsequently had to fill to the low points. Finally, an equal gage reading of 235.66 cm was observed after leveling the plot. The laser leveler (Leica MLS700) was used hitching with a TAFE tractor. The field was leveled with manual control initially and finally it was operated with auto adjustment. Two operators, 25 litter diesels and total 6 hours time were required during this leveling. Wheat was cultivated in leveled land (T 1 ) and non-leveled land (T 2 ). Laser leveling was insured for improvement in nutrient use efficiencies, option for precision farming, reduces weed problems, and improves uniformity of crop maturity. There was better distribution of water in leveled plot, which helped to reduce irrigation application time 1 hour. Due to uniformity of moisture content improved germination and crop establishment was found which reflected in higher plant population (239 m -2 ). Maximum yield (3.41 t ha -1 ) was obtained in T 1 due to longer panicle (10.89 cm), more grain per plant (27.47) and 1000 grain weight (47.38 g) compared to yield of T 2 (2.62 t ha -1 ).

a69294512eed2212489127120605f20b32148a42,Development of an Indicator to Monitor Mediterranean Wetlands,"Wetlands are sensitive ecosystems that are increasingly subjected to threats from anthropogenic factors. In the last decades, coastal Mediterranean wetlands have been suffering considerable pressures from land use change, intensification of urban growth, increasing tourism infrastructure and intensification of agricultural practices. Remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques are efficient tools that can support monitoring Mediterranean coastal wetlands on large scales and over long periods of time. The study aims at developing a wetland indicator to support monitoring Mediterranean coastal wetlands using these techniques. The indicator makes use of multi-temporal Landsat images, land use reference layers, a 50m numerical model of the territory (NMT) and Corine Land Cover (CLC) for the identification and mapping of wetlands. The approach combines supervised image classification techniques making use of vegetation indices and decision tree analysis to identify the surface covered by wetlands at a given date. A validation process is put in place to compare outcomes with existing local wetland inventories to check the results reliability. The indicator´s results demonstrate an improvement in the level of precision of change detection methods achieved by traditional tools providing reliability up to 95% in main wetland areas. The results confirm that the use of RS techniques improves the precision of wetland detection compared to the use of CLC for wetland monitoring and stress the strong relation between the level of wetland detection and the nature of the wetland areas and the monitoring scale considered.",2015,13,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0122694,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a69294512eed2212489127120605f20b32148a42,JournalArticle,PLoS ONE

3bdc279ece1ab0a3155f9e1a2c1bb9b92e3c85a9,An Application of Fuzzy C-Means Based Clustering Technique in Smart Farming,"Customised farming has seen ever increasing interest of next level farming practices across the globe by the modern agronomist of the age. Customized Management practices (CMP) make use of creating management zones (MZs’), leading to precision farming through application of variable rate technology for soil inputs. In this paper site-specific Apparent Electrical conductivity (ECa) and crop yield information have been used to study the spatial distribution and variability of the land. Matlab 8.5 version was used to implement Fuzzy c-means clustering in order to cluster the data and various performance indices such as NCE, FPI and their ifference were calculated to determine the clustering performance. Both the clusters (ECa and crop yield) were mapped and good amount of overlap was observed indicating the relationship between ECa and crop yield. Introduction Agriculture production system is an outcome of complex interaction of seed, soil, water and agro-chemicals. Therefore, judicious management of all the inputs is essential for the sustainability of such a complex system. It is also certain that availability of labour is also going to be a major worry for the agriculture lands. So it is imperative to utilize the resources judiciously and effectively. Precision farming merges the new technology borne out of information age and mature agriculture industry. It is an integrated crop management system that attempts to match the kind and amount of inputs with the actual crop needs for small areas in the field. This goal although is not new but the modern technology and advancements allow this concept to take shape. New information tools not only serve to manage within-field variability but also general aspects of farming such as documentation of field work. Precision agriculture (PA) emerged with the application of new technologies in farming such as GPS, new sensing techniques and variable rate technology, enabling local field measurement and adjustment of local inputs. But the precision agriculture system is not yet complete. Especially, decision support in precision management needs to be further developed so that detailed field information may be used in an effective way in precise field management. The objective of the research described here is clustering of soil parameters, and comparing this with the yield results. Another clustering was performed, using apparent soil Electrical Conductivity (ECa) and yield of Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) fields. This was used as a means to highlight the soil-yield interaction in the field. The interpolation methods and grid size of the soil and crop data can influence the analysis result. Materials and Methodology Survey data of geo-referenced ECa of soil has been collected on three experimental fields. Sites description.Sensor measured soil properties and yield were measured during the 2010 season, on field scale basis with summer paddy, varieties such as PBW 343, PBW 550 and DBW 17. The normal crop protection measures were taken, including herbicides, stem growth reduction and fungicides. The field was harvested in May 010.Numbered plots with dimensions as per below mentioned details were established on the field. Post harvesting different varieties of paddy fields during 2010 summers,the field survey was conducted on these three experimental fields situated in International Conference on Intelligent Systems Research and Mechatronics Engineering (ISRME 2015) © 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 744 Punjab agricultural University (PAU),Ludhiana, (INDIA).

This field of study is rapidly increasing due to the benefits and advantages for farm resources management, particularly for studying crop health. This paper reports some experiences related to the analysis of cultivations (vineyards and tomatoes) with Tetracam multispectral data. The Tetracam camera was mounted on a multi-rotor hexacopter. The multispectral data were processed with a photogrammetric pipeline to create triband orthoimages of the surveyed sites. Those orthoimages were employed to extract some Vegetation Indices (VI) such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), examining the vegetation vigor for each crop. The paper demonstrates the great potential of high-resolution UAV data and photogrammetric techniques applied in the agriculture framework to collect multispectral images and evaluate different VI, suggesting that these instruments represent a fast, reliable, and cost-effective resource in crop assessment for precision farming applications.",2015,665,32,10.3390/rs70404026,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b2e28bec2b8a2708103865524a4a19b957e3b91,"JournalArticle,Review",Remote Sensing

We propose an approach based on cooccurrence analysis in each document for which we used document organization to improve accuracy of relation extraction. This approach is implemented in a R package called \emph{x.ent}. Another facet of extraction relies on use of extracted relation into a querying system for expert end-users.

I speak from my own experience of trying to understand current practices and related challenges: this is not possible unless we delve deep into both history and the specific local situation. Andrei Dörre has embraced this challenge and succeeded in giving a broad overview of what is at stake today in Kyrgyz resource governance. But why focus on pastures? Pastures are the largest land use category in Kyrgyzstan, and livestock breeding has become a major source of income for much of the rural population. Accordingly, pasture-related social and environmental problems have a direct impact on people’s livelihoods, and this implies a certain urgency to understand their context and find solutions. This book is a valuable basis, above all, for understanding the diverse factors that influence the concrete situation on the ground. The book opens with a chapter on structural social insecurities in postSoviet Kyrgyzstan, with the main focus on shortcomings in terms of governance and participation. The second chapter introduces the characteristics of Kyrgyz pasturelands and related social and ecological challenges. The subsequent extended chapter on concepts and methods of analysis—in which the author explains his understanding of transformation, the chosen analytical framework of political ecology, and the methods he used—presumably results from the fact that the book is based on a doctoral dissertation. Next, the author zooms in on pasture use and related challenges in the walnut region in Bazar Korgon district, southwestern Kyrgyzstan, where he did his fieldwork. Due to its large wooded areas, this region is not necessarily representative of major parts of the country. Nonetheless, by describing the particularities of pasture use in this area, the subsequent chapters offer valuable insights into governance mechanisms and related challenges that exist throughout Kyrgyzstan. The chapter on the historical preconditions of current pasture challenges is one of the most interesting, showing in detail and with precision which historical events may have had long-term effects on pasture use. In the khanates of the preRussian era, for example, pasture use was in the hands of powerful leaders. They organized it not by allocating fixed areas but predominantly by negotiating ‘‘rights to move’’ with other leaders according to the ecological condition of the pastures in question. The geopolitically and economically motivated colonial conquest of Central Asia by the Russian Empire in the 19th century marked the beginning of mobile livestock owners’ assignment to fixed pasture areas. This development was driven above all by considerations of fiscal registration and control. With the establishment of Soviet power in the 20th century and the paradigm shift towards intensification, means of production—such as pastureland, livestock, or infrastructure—were converted into state or collective property, and many people were withdrawn from livestock breeding and agriculture to work in other economic sectors. Dörre concludes that one commonality of the different historical eras since the Russian colonization is that pasture use systems were always governed by external interventions and based on ideas of development. In the last large chapter, the author analyzes current pasture use from a political ecology perspective, providing detailed insights into the challenges faced today in the walnut region. Among the most prominent are conflicts over access to pasture resources, competition for their use, inadequate management, and pasture degradation. Dörre names a number of root causes, including: a lack of alternative income opportunities; structural inadequacies within the institutions responsible for resource management and the allocation of pasture entitlements; pasture legislation that is partly inadequate in the local context; a lack of awareness among many pasture users of the relevant legal relationships; and a concurrent unreliability of the judiciary. He also argues that the fragmentation with regard to patterns, practices, and intensities of pasture use can be interpreted as a reflection of Kyrgyzstan’s socioeconomically stratified postsocialist society. The arguments in this chapter are brought to life by several portraits of individual pasture users: the story of a former librarian and forester, for example, illustrates how the collapse of the Soviet system changed his family’s livelihood. Due to the loss of his former secure position and regular income, they now depend on a mixture of maize and potato cultivation, forest product harvesting, child allowances, pasturing services for relatives and friends, and the sale of livestock products. Since he has no lease agreement for the use of summer pastures, he regularly has to obtain permission from the forestry administration.

61f354eac5774be3154ee9ea27052948f550a610,Sustainable diet studies show co-benefits for greenhouse gas emissions and public health.,"Dear Editor: 
 
Because agriculture contributes about one-fifth of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, sustainable diets offer an opportunity for climate change mitigation. Many recent studies have assessed the environmental and health impacts of sustainable diets, finding that realistic shifts in intake can reduce GHG emissions and have public health cobenefits. However, the recent review of sustainable diets by Auestad and Fulgoni (1) implies that there is, as of yet, little clear benefit from changing diets. 
 
The authors state that mitigation efforts should not focus on diets, because nonagricultural emissions account for the majority of global emissions. However, nonagricultural emissions are split across several sectors. Agriculture, forestry, and other land use change is the second-largest contributor (24%), behind energy (35%). Industry, transport, and buildings individually contribute 21%, 14%, and 6%, respectively (2). There is no single silver bullet for GHG mitigation, and deep cuts in emissions will be easier to achieve if each sector implements mitigation strategies. 
 
The review also suggested that results across these studies are inconclusive. Although the authors are correct that methods of comparing diets and measuring environmental outcomes do differ, the emission trends across studies mostly differ in magnitude, not direction. Two out of 37 dietary scenarios across 12 studies calculated higher emissions for healthier diets (3). However, these compared scenarios in which meat intake did not meaningfully change between healthy and unhealthy diets (4), and in which meat was replaced by the caloric equivalent of fruit and vegetables (5). The latter study’s other scenarios, which substituted meat with dairy or mixed food groups, produced fewer emissions (5). These few exceptions highlight that convergence of healthy and lower-emission diets is possible, though with careful and realistic substitution of foods (6). The effects on emissions also depend on the type of meat replaced, because poultry and pork have considerably fewer emissions than ruminant meat. 
 
We agree that additional research is required to add precision to the environmental effects of sustainable diets, but this is not an argument for inaction. Particularly, there is a need for emission estimates for a larger variety of foods and their regional variation, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Studies in these countries are also needed to estimate the scope of current and future dietary emissions. Here, mitigation opportunities from recent shifts to Western diets may be countered by rising emissions from undernourished populations who require higher dietary diversity and caloric intakes, and who may benefit from consumption of some animal-based products. 
 
The current body of research, despite methodological differences, generally shows that reducing intake of animal-based products—particularly ruminant meat—proportionally decreases dietary GHG emissions (3). Additionally, increased consumption of fruit and vegetables (but not refined carbohydrates) can improve health in many populations. 
 
The transition to sustainable diets may also not be as problematic as the authors describe. Indeed, the literature has shown that in most settings, even bridging current population-level gaps between current and recommended dietary intakes could alone bring GHG reductions and improve health (3). Adverse economic impacts could be addressed by appropriate policies (6).",2015,7,0,10.3945/an.115.008466,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61f354eac5774be3154ee9ea27052948f550a610,"LettersAndComments,Review",Advances in Nutrition

Non-contact measurement with an infrared thermometer is useful for detecting leaf temperatures. In this study, a novel technique was developed to measure leaf emissivity using an infrared thermometer with an infrared sensor and a thermocouple wire. The measured values were transformed into true temperatures by calibration equations to improve the measurement accuracy. The relationship between two kinds of measurement temperatures and setting emissivities was derived as a model for calculating of true emissivity. The emissivities of leaves of three crops were calculated by the mathematical equation developed in this study. The mean emissivities were 0.9809, 0.9783, 0.981 and 0.9848 for Phalaenopsis mature and new leaves and Paphiopedilum and Malabar chestnut leaves, respectively. Emissivity differed significantly between leaves of Malabar chestnut and the two orchids. The range of emissivities determined in this study was similar to that in the literature. The precision of the measurement is acceptable. The method developed in this study is a real-time, in situ technique and could be used for agricultural and forestry plants.",2015,59,14,10.3390/s150511387,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93b3b7a19a54a3a405edcd8bc1e14dfae3849d3c,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

73288675f0fe0b56e8ceeb0fc0abbd03da17c288,Gaussian Process Decentralized Data Fusion and Active Sensing for Spatiotemporal Traffic Modeling and Prediction in Mobility-on-Demand Systems,"Mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems have recently emerged as a promising paradigm of one-way vehicle sharing for sustainable personal urban mobility in densely populated cities. We assume the capability of a MoD system to be enhanced by deploying robotic shared vehicles that can autonomously cruise the streets to be hailed by users. A key challenge of the MoD system is that of real-time, fine-grained mobility demand and traffic flow sensing and prediction. This paper presents novel Gaussian process (GP) decentralized data fusion and active sensing algorithms for real-time, fine-grained traffic modeling and prediction with a fleet of MoD vehicles. The predictive performance of our decentralized data fusion algorithms are theoretically guaranteed to be equivalent to that of sophisticated centralized sparse GP approximations. We derive consensus filtering variants requiring only local communication between neighboring vehicles. We theoretically guarantee the performance of our decentralized active sensing algorithms. When they are used to gather informative data for mobility demand prediction, they can achieve a dual effect of fleet rebalancing to service mobility demands. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our algorithms are significantly more time-efficient and scalable in the size of data and fleet while achieving predictive performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art algorithms. Note to Practitioners-Knowing, understanding, and predicting spatiotemporally varying traffic phenomena in real time has become increasingly important to the goal of achieving smooth-flowing, congestion-free traffic in densely populated urban cities, which motivates our work here. This paper addresses the following fundamental problem of data fusion and active sensing: How can a fleet of autonomous robotic vehicles or mobile probes actively cruise a road network to gather and assimilate the most informative data for predicting a spatiotemporally varying traffic phenomenon like a mobility demand pattern or traffic flow? Existing centralized solutions are poorly suited because they suffer from a single point of failure and incur huge communication, space, and time overheads with large data and fleet. This paper proposes novel efficient and scalable decentralized data fusion and active sensing algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees. The practical applicability of our algorithms is not restricted to traffic monitoring [1]-[4]; they can be used in other environmental sensing applications such as mineral prospecting [5], precision agriculture, monitoring of ocean/freshwater phenomena (e.g., plankton bloom) [6]-[9], forest ecosystems, pollution (e.g., oil spill), or contamination. Note that the decentralized data fusion component of our algorithms can also be used for static sensors and passive mobile probes and, interestingly, adapted to parallel implementations to be run on a cluster of machines for achieving efficient and scalable probabilistic prediction (i.e., with predictive uncertainty) with large data. Empirical results show that our algorithms can perform well with two datasets featuring real-world traffic phenomena in the densely-populated urban city of Singapore. A limitation of our algorithms is that the decentralized data fusion components assume independence between multiple traffic phenomena while the decentralized active sensing components only work for a single traffic phenomenon. So, in our future work, we will generalize our algorithms to perform active sensing of multiple traffic phenomena and remove the assumption of independence between them.",2015,105,5,10.1109/TASE.2015.2422852,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73288675f0fe0b56e8ceeb0fc0abbd03da17c288,JournalArticle,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering

The rapid evolution of information communication technologies and geographical science offers enormous potential for the development of optimized solutions for distributed information for precision viticulture. Recent technological developments have allowed useful tools to be elaborated that help in the monitoring and control of many aspects of vine growth. Precision viticulture thus seeks to exploit the widest range of available observations to describe the vineyard spatial variability with high resolution, and provide recommendations to improve management efficiency in terms of quality, production, and sustainability.

c4dc85d116ac2942cad7bd8c46609e71187bce69,Function genomics of abiotic stress tolerance in plants: a CRISPR approach,"Various abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity, heat, flooding, ion toxicity and radiation are the major constraints to agricultural production. The understanding of molecular basis of plant response to these environmental conditions has been a major focus of research in the past decades. Several genes/pathways and regulatory networks involved in stress responses have been worked out employing various approaches. Quite a few of these components have been used for engineering abiotic stress tolerance in model and crop plants via classical biotechnological and/or breeding approaches. Success to generate stress-tolerant plants has been achieved to some extent, which has resulted in increased crop yield (Mickelbart et al., 2015). However, novel strategies are desirable to overcome the limitations of classical methods, such as lack of precision and requirement of substantial time to increase the crop production in the current climate change and ever increasing population scenario. The recent availability of genome editing tools provides ample opportunity to introduce targeted modifications in the genome efficiently to study the functional aspects of various components of the genome in diverse plants and offers potential avenues for production of abiotic stress-tolerant crop plants. 
 
Genome editing tools provide a method for introducing targeted mutation, insertion/deletion (indel) and precise sequence modification using customized nucleases in a wide variety of organisms. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated nuclease 9) are the most commonly used genome editing tools (Voytas, 2013; Mahfouz et al., 2014; Kumar and Jain, 2015). In general, these sequence-specific nucleases cause double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the target genomic locus/loci, which is/are repaired by the intracellular repair pathways; nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR). NHEJ leads to the introduction of indels and HDR can be used to introduce specific point mutations or insertion of desired sequences (such as tags or new domains) via recombination. Owing to the simplicity of programming, CRISPR-Cas9 system has opened a plethora of options for genome editing in various biological contexts. Here, we highlight the emerging applications and future avenues of CRISPR-Cas9 system to understand the biology of abiotic stress tolerance in plants.",2015,71,1,10.3389/fpls.2015.00375,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c4dc85d116ac2942cad7bd8c46609e71187bce69,JournalArticle,Frontiers in Plant Science

The paper proposes a software prototype system for early pest identification on the infected crops in greenhouse. Images of the infected leaf are captured by a camera with virtual pan tilt and zoom and processed using image processing techniques to identify presence of pests. Advanced SVM classifier is used to identify affected leaf and used for classification of pest. This SVM classifier helps in the classification of pest based on their features. Results show more precision in identifying the presence of pest at early stage. Entire life cycle of whiteflies is 21-36 days. Thrips are tiny, slender pest about 1/25-inch long in length. They range in colour from light brown to black. Thripes grows on flower plants and fruit plants. Aphids are very small in size. Aphids are soft-bodied, sluggish pests. They form cluster in colonies on the leaves of the host plants. Their life span is 20 to 30 days. The only way to stop the effect of these pests is pesticides. But excess use of the pesticides is very harmful to the crops, soil, air, water resources and the animals which came in contact with the pesticides. Pesticide residues have also been found in rain and groundwater. The use of pesticides decreases the general biodiversity in the soil. Excess of pesticides results in reduced nitrogen fixation and thus reduced crop yields.

8c55c901c540a88f10d2746c5224ce7a1cf7cce3,Additional Yaw Moment Control of a 4WIS and 4WID Agricultural Data Acquisition Vehicle,"A four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) and a four-wheel independent driving (4WID) agricultural data acquisition vehicle (ADAV) system was designed to monitor and manage the growing status of bio-energy crops. To avoid destroying crops, a changeable wheel gauge and high-clearance design was employed, which brought new problems to the ADAV system: reduced path-following precision and driving stability. Given the dynamic characteristics of the ADAV system, an additional yaw moment control (AYC) system was designed to achieve high path-following precision and stability of the ADAV system. Using the input steering wheel angle and driving speed, the desired yaw rate and sideslip angle were calculated.

The effectiveness of the AYC system was verified in field tests. Experimental results show that the actual yaw rate, sideslip angle and path trajectory were close to the desired ones.

887a56489a85228169247aeeab277ef15d37290b,Yield prediction in banana (Musa × paradisiaca) (cv Grand Naine) by ANN models,"in understanding perennial crop growth cycle in view of recent climate changes and thereby to identify potential traits based on which advance selection could be attempted for a desirable trait at early crop growth stage. Also, identified significant biometrical traits across crop growth stages may be an effective component of any effective precision farming management package for increasing crop productivity. Role of biometrical factors in crop modeling is gaining importance in horticultural studies (Venugopalan 2010). To achieve this, development of statistical models based on recorded biometrical traits across crop growth stages is highly essential. Multiple linear regression (MLR) modeling is a very powerful statistical technique and is widely used to estimate linear relationship between response variable and predictors. Its main limitation is that it is useful only when the underlying relation between response and predictor variables is assumed to be “linear”. However, in a realistic situation, this assumption is rarely satisfied. Also, if there are several predictors, it is wellnigh impossible to have an idea of underlying non-linear functional relationship between response and predictor variables. To this end, in the present study, models based on the theory of “Artificial neural networks” (ANN), which can handle non-linear pattern among the independent factors (Singh and Prajneshu 2008) based on prior knowledge of the system (Hochachka et al. 2007), are developed and stage-wise significant yield influencing characters in banana (Musa × paradisiaca L.) (cv Grand Naine) are identified. Primary data on yield and yield attributing traits [Plant height (cm), girth (cm), leaf length (cm), leaf breadth (cm), number of functional leaves, number of suckers] across seven important growth stages of banana (Cv Grand Naine) were collected from farmer’s field (n=120) during the period 2010-12, at Dodballapur, Bengaluru.

2b1cdea49f87236a97031fe6e3a79c59570ad0c4,Investigation of Water Dynamics and the Effect of Evapotranspiration on Grain Yield of Rainfed Wheat and Barley under a Mediterranean Environment: A Modelling Approach,"Agro-hydrological models have increasingly become useful and powerful tools in optimizing water and fertilizer application, and in studying the environmental consequences. Accurate prediction of water dynamics in such models is essential for models to produce reasonable results. In this study, detailed simulations were performed for water dynamics of rainfed winter wheat and barley grown under a Mediterranean climate over a 10-year period. The model employed (Yang et al., 2009. J. Hydrol., 370, 177-190) uses easily available agronomic data, and takes into consideration of all key soil and plant processes in controlling water dynamics in the soil-crop system, including the dynamics of root growth. The water requirement for crop growth was calculated according to the FAO56, and the soil hydraulic properties were estimated using peto-transfer functions (PTFs) based on soil physical properties and soil organic matter content. Results show that the simulated values of soil water content at the depths of 15, 45 and 75 cm agreed with the measurements well with the root of the mean squared errors of 0.027 cm3 cm-3 and the model agreement index of 0.875. The simulated seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) ranged from 208 to 388 mm, and grain yield was found to correlate with the simulated seasonal ET in a linear manner within the studied ET range. The simulated rates of grain yield increase were 17.3 and 23.7 kg ha-l for every mm of water evapotranspired for wheat and barley, respectively. The good agreement of soil water content between measurement and simulation and the simulated relationships between grain yield and seasonal ET supported by the data in the literature indicates that the model performed well in modelling water dynamics for the studied soil-crop system, and therefore has the potential to be applied reliably and widely in precision agriculture. Finally, a two-staged approach using inverse modelling techniques to further improve model performance was discussed.",2015,10,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0131360,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b1cdea49f87236a97031fe6e3a79c59570ad0c4,JournalArticle,PLoS ONE

However, these variables are mostly estimated after a time-consuming and hard field work and applying equations that treat the trees as geometric solids, which produce inconsistent results. As an alternative, this work presents an innovative procedure for computing the 3-dimensional geometric features of individual trees and tree-rows by applying two consecutive phases: 1) generation of Digital Surface Models with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology and 2) use of object-based image analysis techniques. Our UAV-based procedure produced successful results both in single-tree and in tree-row plantations, reporting up to 97% accuracy on area quantification and minimal deviations compared to in-field estimations of tree heights and crown volumes. The maps generated could be used to understand the linkages between tree grown and field-related factors or to optimize crop management operations in the context of precision agriculture with relevant agro-environmental implications.",2015,212,16,10.1371/journal.pone.0130479,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7cee3de7c28d6d95bea9b27322f01fb50952af37,JournalArticle,PLoS ONE

Soil moisture considered one of environment factors that effect on crop. The period of irrigation must be monitored. Neural network capable of learning the behavior of the agricultural soil in absence of mathematical model. This paper introduced modified type of neural network that is known as Spiking Neural Network (SNN). In this work, the precision agriculture system  is modeled, contains two SNNs which have been identified off-line based on logged data, one of these SNNs represents the monitor that located at sink where the period of irrigation is calculated and the other represents the soil. In addition, to reduce power consumption of sensor nodes Modified Chain-Cluster based Mixed (MCCM) routing algorithm is used. According to MCCM, the sensors will send their packets that are less than threshold moisture level to the sink. The SNN with Modified Spike-Prop (MSP) training algorithm is capable of identifying soil, irrigation periods and monitoring the soil moisture level, this means that SNN has the ability to be an identifier and monitor. By applying this system the particular agriculture area reaches to the desired moisture level.

Using nutrient expert system based site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) practices higher dose of K and N while lower dose of P were estimated for hybrid maize over recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF). Data of the previous crop, target yield, residue management and soil nutrient status were entered in the nutrient expert system. The significant interaction of SSNM and hybrids showed that hybrid PMH 3 along with site specific nutrient management (SSNM) produced significantly higher grain yield under conservation agriculture. The SSNM practice gave 14.7% higher grain yield (5 491 kg/ha) over RDF (4 182 kg/ha). Significantly higher gross return, net return (Rupees 41 137) and B:C ratio (1.57) was obtained with SSNM and the net returns of the maize were improved by rupees 7 856/ha by SSNM over RDF. Amongst genotypes, PMH 3 produced significantly higher gross, net return and B:C ratio over HQPM 1, however, it remained at par with PMH 1, S 6217 and CMH 08-292. Significantly higher partial factor productivity of applied N, P and K was obtained with 50% RDF while it remained at par for applied P by SSNM. Significantly highest agronomic efficiency of applied N and P was obtained with SSNM while for applied K it was significantly highest with 50% RDF. Initially before crop sowing, significantly highest organic carbon in soil was in 100% RDF plots.

Soil is the basis for agriculture, which is relevant for food safety and environmental issues. Mapping and soil management are strategies for planned agriculture and can be assisted by remote sensing. Spectroscopy techniques are faster, less honorable and less polluting when compared to traditional methods. Soils Spectral Library (SSL) composes a diverse and varied database with soil spectra information. Through SSL soil types can be characterize and soil attributes estimated. SSL besides contribute to the soil survey, mapping and soil management it can support precision agriculture, soil attribute modeling, soil contaminated monitoring, communication between the soil scientists and soil conservation. There are SSL worldwide with soil samples from continents, such as Australia, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, but there are few Brazilian samples representative. Thus, the objectives of this study were first to create a Brazilian Soil Spectral Library (BSSB), second to characterize soil spectra of BESB soil classes and finally to quantify soil properties (clay and sand). The BSSL bank received samples from 17 collaborators and institutions from various Brazilian states, including Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso, Goiás, Maranhão, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará, Paraíba, Pará, Roraima, Amazonas and Distrito Federal. The Spectral Library has 19,537 soil samples from auger and profiles. Spectra of several Brazilian soil classes were characterized. Soil profiles and their horizons had their representative spectra characterized with multi-depth analysis.

Maximum levels of these toxins in foods are currently under consideration by the European Commission as a risk management measure. In this study, a new quantitative method is described for the determination of five Alternaria toxins and citrinin in tomato and tomato juice samples based on LC-MS/MS detection. Samples were extracted with pure methanol, followed by a derivatisation step with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to improve the determination of tenuazonic acid and to decrease the wide polarity difference between the compounds of interest. Samples were purified on hydrophilic-modified styrene polymer solid-phase extraction cartridges. High-performance liquid chromatographic columns packed with different core–shell materials were tested for the separation of toxins and a C-18 phase was in the final method applied to achieve sufficient separation of all relevant analytes. A key element of this approach was to prove successful transferability of the method to three different triple quadrupole mass spectrometers. A full single laboratory method validation was performed on two LC-MS/MS systems and performance characteristics met the predefined requirements. Moreover, the method was used in an international proficiency test and the satisfactory z-scores obtained (−0.1 to 0.8 in tomato juice samples) demonstrated the reliability of the approach described. The method will be validated in an inter-laboratory collaborative study and if the criteria for method precision are met, the method will be proposed as a new Work Item to the European Committee for Standardisation.",2015,56,2,10.1080/19440049.2015.1072644,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/226bdfe722b5ca04f5b54b666256b68d87a0d4c2,JournalArticle,Food Additives and Contaminants Part A-chemistry Analysis Control Exposure & Risk Assessment

4cc8abac8a8c3e1e551321bfd5cd4f9af6c9151d,Survey Report on Image Processing in Agriculture,"India is an agricultural country; wherein about 70% of the population depends on agriculture. Agriculture has changed more in the past century than it has since farming began many millennia ago. Research in agriculture is aimed towards increase of productivity and food quality at reduced expenditure and with increased profit. Current crop production practices, often called precision agriculture (PA), benefited from all earlier revolutions in crop production. Many times expert advice may not be affordable, majority times the availability of expert and their services may consume time. Image processing along with availability of communication network can change the situation of getting the expert advice well within time and at affordable cost since image processing was the effective tool for analysis of parameters. Image processing techniques in agriculture are mainly used for image categorization based on shape, size, color and texture for decision-making. This leads to agricultural input rationalization and environmental damage reduction by adjusting the agricultural practices like fertilizer and pesticide application to the site that demands and profit maximization. This paper intends to focus on the survey of application of image processing in agriculture field such as imaging techniques, weed detection and fruit grading.

Despite their great potential impact on agricultural research, few contributions have dealt with the development of automatic control systems for wind tunnels in the field of greenhouse technology. The objective of this paper is to present an automatic control system that provides precision and speed of measurement, as well as efficient data processing in low-speed wind tunnel experiments for greenhouse engineering applications. The system is based on an algorithm that identifies the system model and calculates the optimum PI controller. The validation of the system was performed on a cellulose evaporative cooling pad and on insect-proof screens to assess its response to perturbations. The control system provided an accuracy of <0.06 m·s−1 for airflow speed and <0.50 Pa for pressure drop, thus permitting the reproducibility and standardization of the tests.

SSNM-NE in maize-wheat cropping system (MWCS) assumes a great-significance to restore soil-fertility and enhance farm nutrient-use efficiency with minimal deleterious effects on environment. Therefore, an attempt was made to develop and standardize SSNM-NE technology in MWCS. Results indicated that system-productivity in terms of wheatequivalent yield (WEY) with SSNM-NE + FYM @ 5 tonnes/ha (9.60 Mg/ha) and with 125% recommended NPK(RDF) (9.33 Mg/ha) was ~38.8; 12.3% and 36.8; 9.8% higher over control and 100%RDF (2 yearsâ€™ av.), respectively. Among nutrient-management schedules, SSNM-NE + FYM registered highest available N, K and soil organic carbon (SOC) in 0-15 cm soil-depth which was closely followed by 125%RDF and SSNM treatments while plots under 125%RDF registered significantly highest available P over other treatments. SSNM-NE alongwith FYM led to highest soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) and dehydrogenase-activity which was 9.25 and 11.6% higher over 125%RDF. However, non-significant variation was observed in bulk density at both soil-depths (0â€“15; 15â€“30 cm). SSNM-NE +FYM experienced highest root-length density and root-surface area (RSA) in both crops followed by 125%RDF. SSNM-NE + FYM and SSNM-NE treatments exhibited significantly higher agronomicâ€“efficiency of applied-N and P over rest of the treatments in both crops. Overall, SSNM-NE in combination with FYM led to significant improvement in soil physico-chemical and microbial properties as well as nutrient use-efficiencies; which assume paramount importance for long-term soil productivity that may translate into sustained MWCS productivity in South-Asian IGPR. Besides, this SSNM-NE decision support system software is easy to handle and operationalizable by the field extension functionaries, progressive farmers and through custom hiring services to illiterate and resource poor farmingclientele at village level in developing world.",2015,35,4,10.56093/ijas.v85i8.50796,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d7bc25de9a508773dc310e78c412f592e349eefa,JournalArticle,Indian Journal of Agricultural Sciences

9dca4e246c46b21beaf03725ed6e199efa37e839,RSSI-Based Distributed Self-Localization for Wireless Sensor Networks Used in Precision Agriculture,"In this paper, we propose a received signal strength indication-based distributed Bayesian localization algorithm based on message passing to solve the approximate inference problem. The algorithm is designed for precision agriculture applications, such as pest management and pH sensing in large farms, where greater power efficiency besides communication and computational scalability is needed but location accuracy requirements are less demanding. Communication overhead, which is a key limitation of popular non-Bayesian and Bayesian distributed techniques, is avoided by a message passing schedule, in which outgoing message by each node does not depend on the destination node, and therefore is a fixed size. Fast convergence is achieved by: 1) eliminating the setup phase linked with spanning tree construction, which is frequent in belief propagation schemes and 2) the parallel nature of the updates, since no message needs to be exchanged among nodes during each update, which is called the coupled variables phenomenon in non-Bayesian techniques and accounts for a significant amount of communication overhead. These features make the proposed algorithm highly compatible with realistic wireless sensor network (WSN) deployments, e.g., ZigBee, that are based upon the ad hoc on-demand distance vector, where route request and route reply packets are flooded in the network during route discovery phase.",2015,144,7,10.1109/TWC.2016.2586844,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9dca4e246c46b21beaf03725ed6e199efa37e839,JournalArticle,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications

Agricultural workers can be occupationally exposed to IMZ and the general public indirectly by the diet. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an LC–MS-MS method for the analysis of IMZ in human urine. The method used electrospray ionization and selected reaction monitoring in the positive mode. Excellent linearity was observed in the range 0.5–100 ng/mL. The limit of detection of the method was 0.2 ng/mL, and the limit of quantitation 0.8 ng/mL. The method showed good within-run, between-run and between-batch precision, with a coefficient of variation <15%. The method was applied to analyze urine samples obtained from two human volunteers following experimental oral and dermal exposure. The excretion of IMZ seemed to follow a two-compartment model and first-order kinetics. In the oral exposure, the elimination half-life of IMZ in the rapid excretion phase was 2.6 and 1.9 h for the female and the male volunteer, respectively. In the slower excretion phase, it was 7.6 and 13 h, respectively. In the dermal exposure, the excretion seemed to follow a single-compartment model and first-order kinetics. The elimination half-life was 10 and 6.6 h for the female and the male volunteer, respectively.

081454123e17e8f0eaf1caae25390be180feabad,Validation of an HPLC Analytical Method for Determination of Biogenic Amines in Agricultural Products and Monitoring of Biogenic Amines in Korean Fermented Agricultural Products,"An HPLC analytical method was validated for the quantitative determination of biogenic amines in agricultural products. Four agricultural foods, including apple juice, Juk , corn oil and peanut butter, were selected as food matrices based on their water and fat contents (i.e., non-fatty liquid, non-fatty solid, fatty liquid and fatty solid, respectively). The precision, accuracy, recovery, limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were determined to test the validity of an HPLC procedure for the determination of biogenic amines, including tryptamine, β-phenylethylamine, putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, tyramine, spermidine and spermine, in each matrix. The LODs and LOQs for the biogenic amines were within the range of 0.01~0.10 mg/kg and 0.02~0.31 mg/kg, respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of intraday for biogenic amine concentrations ranged from 1.86 to 5.95%, whereas the RSD of interday ranged from 2.08 to 5.96%. Of the matrices spiked with biogenic amines, corn oil with tyramine and Juk with putrescine exhibited the least accuracy of 84.85% and recovery rate of 89.63%, respectively, at the lowest concentration (10 mg/kg). Therefore, the validation results fulfilled AOAC criteria and recommendations. Subsequently, the method was applied to the analysis of biogenic amines in fermented agricultural products for a total dietary survey in Korea. Although the results revealed that Korean traditional soy sauce and Doenjang contained relatively high levels of histamine, the amounts are of no concern if these fermented agricultural products serve as condiments.",2015,45,0,10.5487/TR.2015.31.3.299,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/081454123e17e8f0eaf1caae25390be180feabad,"JournalArticle,Review",Toxicological Research
108d92ce53a9ab1ae039872003c431b7e7b3a97e,Hyperspectral Surface Reflectance Data Detect Low Moisture Status of Pecan Orchards during Flood Irrigation,"For large fields, remote sensing might permit plant low moisture status to be detected early, and this may improve drought detection and monitoring. The objective of this study was to determine whether canopy and soil surface reflectance data derived from a handheld spectroradiometer can detect moisture status assessed usingmidday stem water potential (csmd) in pecan (Carya illinoinensis) during cyclic flood irrigations. We conducted the study simultaneously on two mature pecan orchards, one in a sandy loam (La Mancha) and the other in a clay loam (Leyendecker) soil. We were particularly interested in detecting moisture status in the L0.90 to L1.5 MPa csmd range because our previous studies indicated this was the critical range for irrigating pecan. Midday stem water potential, photosynthesis (A) and canopy and soil surface reflectance measurements were taken over the course of irrigation dry-down cycles at csmd levels of L0.40 to L0.85 MPa (well watered) and L0.9 to L1.5 MPa (water deficit). The decline inA averaged 34% in LaMancha and 25% in Leyendecker orchardwhencsmd ranged fromL0.9 toL1.5 MPa. Average canopy surface reflectance of well-watered trees (csmd L0.4 toL0.85 MPa) was significantly higher than the same trees experiencing water deficits (csmd L0.9 to L1.5 MPa) within the 350to 2500-nm bands range. Conversely, soil surface reflectance of well-watered trees was lower than water deficit trees over all bands. At both orchards, coefficient of determinations betweencsmd and all soil and canopy bands and surface reflectance indices were less than 0.62. But discriminant analysis models derived from combining soil and canopy reflectance data of wellwatered and water-deficit trees had high classification accuracy (overall and cross-validation classification accuracy >80%). A discriminant model that included triangular vegetation index (TVI), photochemical reflectance index (PRI), and normalized soilmoisture index (NSMI) had 85%overall accuracy and 82%cross-validation accuracy at LaMancha orchard. At Leyendecker, either a discriminantmodel weightedwith two soil bands (690 and 2430 nm) or a discriminant model that used PRI and soil band 2430 nm had an overall classification and cross-validation accuracy of 99%. In summary, the results presented here suggest that canopy and soil hyperspectral data derived from a handheld spectroradiometer hold promise for discerning the csmd of pecan orchards subjected to flood irrigation. Pecan is a large deciduous tree that is cultivated primarily for its nuts. With an annual production of 139 million kilograms, the United States is the world’s largest producer of pecan. The total area of pecan orchards in the United States is 236,000 ha; New Mexico pecan cultivation accounts for 7% of that area. In 2012, New Mexico produced 31.3 million kilograms (inshell basis) of pecan, 23% of total U.S. production (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2012). New Mexico has an arid to semiarid climate. Much of the pecan cultivation occurs in riparian areas, especially along the Rio Grande River, where water can be diverted for irrigation. However, this supply of surface water often is limited. This means that farmers also must pump groundwater to supplement irrigation, which makes pecan vulnerable to water deficits. Low soil moisture negatively affects several physiological processes in pecan trees, such as photosynthesis (A) and gas exchange (Othman et al., 2014a). Water deficit reduced pecan yield 5% to 24% when the applied water was reduced from 5% to 52% relative to control (Garrot et al., 1993). For the pecan farmer, irrigation must be scheduled to maximize pecan growth and nut production while minimizing costs associated with water appropriation and application. Effective irrigation schedules rely on irrigation application only when an indicator variable reaches a threshold value (Cifre et al., 2005). This indicator variable must be sufficiently sensitive to water status so that the threshold at which irrigation Received for publication 15 Apr. 2015. Accepted for publication 2 June 2015.

SCI. 140(5):449–458. 2015. 449 starts can be determined with some precision (Jones, 2004). Midday stem water potential has been proposed for detecting moisture status and monitoring irrigation in commercial orchards, including pecan (Jones, 2004; Othman et al., 2014a). However, using ysmd for irrigation scheduling, especially, on a large scale is labor intensive (therefore, expensive), slow, and unsuitable for automation (Jones, 2004). Remote sensing applications hold potential for predicting plant water status, growth, and development (Othman et al., 2014a; Rossi et al., 2010). Hyperspectral sensors measure reflectance in a narrow wavelength range (usually 10 nm or less) and contain hundreds of contiguous bands over the electromagnetic spectrum that can be used to estimate the biochemical properties of vegetation (Huber et al., 2008). There has been considerable success in relating hyperspectral reflectance indices to plant physiological properties. For example, the water band index has been shown to be related to surface-atmosphere fluxes of CO2 and H2O (Claudio et al., 2006). Hyperspectral reflectance within the 705to 750-nm spectral range successfully detects water deficit in apple (Malus domestica) trees (Kim et al., 2011), and holds promise for doing so in pecan. In grape (Vitis vinifera), the reflectance-based water index effectively tracked variation in leaf stomatal conductance (R = 0.81) at a predawn leaf water potential of –0.42 MPa (Serrano et al., 2010). Moisture stress index and vegetation moisture index which incorporate the 850and 1928-nm spectral bands showed significant strong correlations with equivalent water thickness in 21 Eucalyptus sp. subjected to deficit irrigation (Datt, 1999). Sims and Gamon (2003) concluded that the 1150to 1260-nm and 1520to 1540-nm wavelength regions can penetrate more deeply into canopies and may be used to accurately detect tree water status. Although the 1944-nm band yielded the best correlation with available soil water, this band is not recommended for practical use because its location in a strong water vapor absorption area makes measurements from space difficult (Weidong et al., 2003). In olive trees (Olea europaea), PRI derived from airborne hyperspectral scanner sensor was sensitive to water stress indicators, such as stomatal conductance and ysmd (Su arez et al., 2008). However, leaf orientation and soil background significantly affected PRI derived from airborne sensor data leading Su arez et al. (2008) to conclude that canopy structure must be considered when PRI is used. In a previous study, we screened several leaf-level physiological measurements to determine which of these leaf-level parameters best represented changes in plant moisture status (Othman et al., 2014a). We concluded that ysmd was the best performing physiological indicator for detecting moisture status in pecan trees (Othman et al., 2014a). We also found thatysmd of –0.9 to –1.5 MPa was the critical water status range to prevent significant reduction in A and gas exchange (>50%) in pecan (Othman et al., 2014b). It is not known whether vegetation indices derived from advanced sensing technologies can precisely predict water status within this range of ysmd (–0.9 to –1.5). The objective of this study was to investigate whether hyperspectral remotely sensed data derived from a handheld spectroradiometer could detect pecan low water status as estimated using ysmd. Materials and Methods SITE DESCRIPTION. The study was conducted in two mature pecan orchards in the Mesilla Valley near Las Cruces, NM, from May 2012 to Nov. 2013. One orchard was at the New Mexico State University Leyendecker Plant Science Research Center [Leyendecker (lat . 32 12#01.14##N, long. 106 44#30.32##W) and a privately owned farm in the northern Mesilla Valley [La Mancha (lat. 32 17#06.25##N, long. 106 50#04.26##W)]. Trees from La Mancha orchard were grown in sandy loam soil [Brazito very fine sandy loam, thick surface (mixed, thermic Typic Torripsamments)], whereas Leyendecker trees were grown in clay loam soil [Armijo clay loam (fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Typic Torrerts)] (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1980). Both orchards were composed of rows ‘Western’ pecan (75%) and pollenizer rows of ‘Wichita’ pecan (25%). All measurements were made on ‘Western’. Trees from La Mancha orchard were 30 years old, 9 to 11 m high, spaced at 6 to 7 m within rows and 8 to 10 m between rows. The total area of the La Mancha orchard was 7 ha. Urea [46% N (250 kg ha)] and zinc sulfate (foliar spray, 8 kg ha) were applied once in May and July of both years. The field was flood irrigated once every 16 to 24 d fromMay to October every year. Leyendecker orchard trees were 20 to 30 years old, 7 to 9 m high, spaced at 6 to 7 m within rows and 8 m between rows. The total area of Leyendecker orchard was 4 ha. Urea (225 kg ha) and zinc sulfate (7 kg ha) were applied once in May of both years. The field was flood irrigated once every 3 to 10 weeks from May to October. METEOROLOGICAL DATA. Meteorological instruments were fixed on a 9.0-m tower above the orchard floor at La Mancha and on a 7.5-m tower at Leyendecker. Instruments were Table 1.

A simple method was established for a rapid and accurate determination of 12 types of HCAs (IQ, MeIQ, Glu-P-1, Glu-P-2, MeIQx, Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2, PhIP, AαC, MeAαC, Harman and Norharman) and acrylamide in three food matrices (non-fat liquid, non-fat solid and fat solid) by isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In every sample, a mixture of internal standards including IQ-d_3, MeIQx-d_3, PhIP-d_3, Trp-P-2-^13C_2-^15N and MeAαC-d_3 was spiked for quantification of HCAs and ^13C_3-acrylamide was also spiked for the analysis of acrylamide. HCAs and acrylamide in sample were extracted with acetonitrile and water, respectively, and then two solid-phase extraction cartridges, ChemElut: HLB for HCAs and Accucat: HLB for acrylamide, were used for efficiently removing interferences such as pigment, lipid, polar, nonpolar and ionic compounds. Established method was validated in terms of recovery, accuracy, precision, limit of detection, limit of quantitation, and linearity. This method showed good precision (RSD < 20%), accuracy (71.8~119.1%) and recovery (66.0~118.9%). The detection limits were < 3.1 ng/g for all analytes. The correlation coefficients for all the HCAs and acrylamide were > 0.995, showing excellent linearity. These methods for the detection of HCAs and acrylamide by LC-MS/MS were applied to real samples and were successfully used for quantitative monitoring in the total diet study and this can be applied to risk assessment in various food matrices.",2015,23,1,10.5487/TR.2015.31.3.255,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/759a228d3c0662160d4209d75e140ad6ecf6a4da,JournalArticle,Toxicological Research

a611e4c7a4d985c444a8d91ffc1ae6d0bb7114dc,Selection and validation of potato candidate genes for maturity corrected resistance to Phytophthora infestans based on differential expression combined with SNP association and linkage mapping,"Late blight of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary, is one of the most important bottlenecks of potato production worldwide. Cultivars with high levels of durable, race unspecific, quantitative resistance are part of a solution to this problem. However, breeding for quantitative resistance is hampered by the correlation between resistance and late plant maturity, which is an undesirable agricultural attribute. The objectives of our research are (i) the identification of genes that condition quantitative resistance to P. infestans not compromised by late plant maturity and (ii) the discovery of diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to be used as molecular tools to increase efficiency and precision of resistance breeding. Twenty two novel candidate genes were selected based on comparative transcript profiling by SuperSAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) in groups of plants with contrasting levels of maturity corrected resistance (MCR). Reproducibility of differential expression was tested by quantitative real time PCR and allele specific pyrosequencing in four new sets of genotype pools with contrasting late blight resistance levels, at three infection time points and in three independent infection experiments. Reproducibility of expression patterns ranged from 28 to 97%. Association mapping in a panel of 184 tetraploid cultivars identified SNPs in five candidate genes that were associated with MCR. These SNPs can be used in marker-assisted resistance breeding. Linkage mapping in two half-sib families (n = 111) identified SNPs in three candidate genes that were linked with MCR. The differentially expressed genes that showed association and/or linkage with MCR putatively function in phytosterol synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, asparagine synthesis, chlorophyll synthesis, cell wall modification, and in the response to pathogen elicitors.",2015,22,1,10.3389/fgene.2015.00294,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a611e4c7a4d985c444a8d91ffc1ae6d0bb7114dc,JournalArticle,Frontiers in Genetics

d5018bb186da70e01489bcf5734b1adab99e779b,The Potential of Pan-Sharpened EnMAP Data for the Assessment of Wheat LAI,"In modern agriculture, the spatially differentiated assessment of the leaf area index (LAI) is of utmost importance to allow an adapted field management. Current hyperspectral satellite systems provide information with a high spectral but only a medium spatial resolution. Due to the limited ground sampling distance (GSD), hyperspectral satellite images are often insufficient for precision agricultural applications. In the presented study, simulated hyperspectral data of the upcoming Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) mission (30 m GSD) covering an agricultural region were pan-sharpened with higher resolution panchromatic aisaEAGLE (airborne imaging spectrometer for applications EAGLE) (3 m GSD) and simulated Sentinel-2 images (10 m GSD) using the spectral preserving Ehlers Fusion. As fusion evaluation criteria, the spectral angle (αspec) and the correlation coefficient (R) were calculated to determine the spectral preservation capability of the fusion results. Additionally, partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were built based on the EnMAP images, the fused datasets and the original aisaEAGLE hyperspectral data to spatially predict the LAI of two wheat fields. The aisaEAGLE model provided the best results (R2cv = 0.87) followed by the models built with the fused datasets (EnMAP–aisaEAGLE and EnMAP–Sentinel-2 fusion each with a R2cv of 0.75) and the simulated EnMAP data (R2cv = 0.68).

These robots must follow the plant lines with centimeter precision to protect plant growth. For cases in which GPS fails, a camera-based solution is often used for navigation because of the system cost and simplicity. The low-cost plant camera presented here generates images in which plants are contrasted against the soil, thus enabling the use of simple cross-correlation functions to establish high-resolution navigation control in the centimeter range. Based on the foresight provided by images from in front of the vehicle, robust vehicle control can be established without any dead time; as a result, off-loading the main robot control and overshooting can be avoided.",2015,7,0,10.3390/jimaging1010115,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f965fd47a4b98ec9064af9d968743492432342bf,JournalArticle,Journal of Imaging

093f5f33ad8b9c0a3742d7b181ee60e4ecff55c9,Oligonucleotide‐directed mutagenesis for precision gene editing,"Summary Differences in gene sequences, many of which are single nucleotide polymorphisms, underlie some of the most important traits in plants. With humanity facing significant challenges to increase global agricultural productivity, there is an urgent need to accelerate the development of these traits in plants. oligonucleotide‐directed mutagenesis (ODM), one of the many tools of Cibus’ Rapid Trait Development System ( RTDS ™) technology, offers a rapid, precise and non‐transgenic breeding alternative for trait improvement in agriculture to address this urgent need. This review explores the application of ODM as a precision genome editing technology, with emphasis on using oligonucleotides to make targeted edits in plasmid, episomal and chromosomal DNA of bacterial, fungal, mammalian and plant systems. The process of employing ODM by way of RTDS technology has been improved in many ways by utilizing a fluorescence conversion system wherein a blue fluorescent protein (BFP) can be changed to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) by editing a single nucleotide of the BFP gene (CAC→TAC; H66 to Y66). For example, dependent on oligonucleotide length, applying oligonucleotide‐mediated technology to target the BFP transgene in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts resulted in up to 0.05% precisely edited GFP loci. Here, the development of traits in commercially relevant plant varieties to improve crop performance by genome editing technologies such as ODM, and by extension RTDS , is reviewed.",2015,131,12,10.1111/pbi.12496,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/093f5f33ad8b9c0a3742d7b181ee60e4ecff55c9,"Review,JournalArticle",Plant Biotechnology Journal

836de52cda0e542defa62c8b4d27617d0b6244a6,Genfundne gravhøje i Nordjylland – Kartografiske studier,"Rediscovered burial mounds in northern Jutland – a cartographical surveyIn 2005-07, archaeologists from the Historical Museum of Northern Jutland carried out an inspection of those burial mounds still visible and protected (scheduled) under Danish cultural heritage legislation. Scheduled burial mounds were the main focus, but new – or rather forgotten – mounds were also observed in the forests (fig. 1). These observations prompted a preliminary study of a small area, which revealed that a large number of burial mounds, hitherto unrecorded in the national archaeological database, Sites and Monuments – Fund og Fortidsminder, are marked on historical maps. This was especially true of the first cadastral maps, known as Original 1 maps, on which a large number of these monuments are marked. But the first edition topographical maps, known as Høje Målebordsblade, also show mounds that are not included in the national database. A major study was initiated in 2008 and the mounds marked on the earliest cadastral maps were recorded, leading to an increase of 33 % in the numbers mapped. This article is a source-critical examination of the use of these maps.The survey area corresponded to the archaeological area of responsibility of the Historical Museum of Northern Jutland and comprises 8% of the total land area of modern Denmark. Information on land-use in historical times can be obtained from the Danish Royal Academy of Sciences and Letters’ manuscript maps, i.e. Videnskabernes Selskabs konceptkort, which date back to the late 18th century. The survey area covered both coastal and inland regions and a great variety of vegetation types could be observed – including marshland, heathland and sand dunes (fig. 2).In the late 18th century, several agricultural reforms were initiated, leading to substantial changes in the cultural landscape. New fields were established and the implementation of the statutory instrument on road regulation of 1793 led to stones being robbed from nearby dolmens and burial mounds. This devastation of ancient burial monuments prompted the establishment of the Royal Commission for the Preservation of Antiquities, Oldsagskommissionen, in 1807, and shortly afterwards a total of 187 mounds and dolmens across the country became protected by law. To stem the continuing destruction, the chief curator of the Danish National Museum, J.J.A. Worsaae, launched systematic surveys of prehistoric monuments throughout the country in 1873. For many years, funding for these so-called “district surveys”, herredsberejsninger, was allocated in the Danish state budget. The surveys only came to an end in 1930, when all the ancient monuments in the country were considered to have been recorded. Most of the monuments in the northern parts of Jutland were recorded during the final decades of the 19th century (fig. 3). The surveys had two main aims: Firstly, to record all ancient monuments and sites still visible, as well as the locations of lost monuments still known to local communities; secondly, to locate the best preserved and most interesting monuments and persuade the landowners to protect these. The district surveys were carried out by the National Museum, and each parish was visited by an antiquarian and an illustrator. Due to the pressure of time, only one or two days were allocated to each of the smaller parishes and, given the contemporary infrastructure and modes of transport, it must be assumed that not all mounds were recorded. The burial mounds were marked on a map but, in a time before GPS, the location of many of them is far from precise. In 1937, a new act for the protection of ancient monuments was passed. The key issue in this legislation was that all visible monuments were now automatically protected by the law. Whether a monument was visible or not was to be decided by the Danish National Museum. In order to do this, all the monuments recorded in the district surveys had to be revisited. This took 20 years and resulted in a grand total of 23,774 monuments and sites across Denmark that were to be protected against future destruction.After some adjustments over the last 80 years, the ancient monuments database now lists a total of 6822 burial mounds in the survey area, of which 2970 are listed as protected monuments. The Sites and Monuments database thereby contains the accumulated records from archaeological surveys carried out over the last 200 years. The burial mounds could be listed under three categories: recorded mounds, unknown mounds and rediscovered mounds, obtained from the maps used in this survey (fig. 4).The first edition topographical maps published in 1842-99, the Høje Målebordsblade, are at a scale of 1:20.000 and the details available from these are both numerous and precise. The maps give a clear picture of the elevation of the terrain and the types of vegetation within a given area (heathland, marshland etc.). They also include most of those burial mounds still visible and thereby provide a detailed source of information on the number of monuments extant in the late 19th century. The accuracy of the mapping of mounds has been evaluated in recent times by way of GPS and shows remarkable precision. Traditional surveying techniques gave positions differing by only a few metres from those determined by modern methods. Approximately 75% of the known preserved mounds were marked on the maps (fig. 5). The mapping was contemporary with the Danish National Museum’s district surveys, but only limited degree of coherence can be observed between the two data sets. This inconsistency can largely be explained by two factors: The archaeologists’ survey was restricted to a few days in each parish and the National Museum wanted to obtain information about monuments no longer discernible in the landscape. In the present study, detailed investigation of the topographical maps yielded a total of 4166 burial mounds. Of these, 326 are not recorded in the Sites and Monuments database and should therefore be regarded as rediscovered mounds. In many cases, the maps contain additional information on the locations of other burial mounds, but these could be anomalies in the terrain contours (fig. 6).Large parts of Denmark were surveyed and mapped following the agricultural reforms of the late 18th century. This resulted in the first cadastral maps, the Original 1 maps, which were drawn at a scale of 1:4000 and therefore contain a great number of details, including much useful information for archaeologists: place names, soil quality, burial mounds etc. (figs. 7 and 8). Each map covers one cadastral district (ejerlav), and the total survey area comprises 608 of these districts. Unfortunately, the mapping was not standardised and not every surveyor used the symbols for burial mounds. Of the 2975 monuments still visible today, only 53% were included on the cadastral district maps, even though these monuments must have been visible 200 years ago (fig. 9). This discrepancy can largely be explained by the lack of standardisation in the mapping, and in some cases the surveyors simply mapped small squares of non-arable area within the arable land (fig. 10). In the present study, only mounds marked with a specific signature were included. Attention should also be drawn to another possible source of bias when working with these maps: They are not static. They were in use for several decades and changes in land ownership, parish borders, field taxation etc. were added to them. Each map therefore contains several layers, each of which represents a historical event. A comparison of the two series of historical maps, the mounds recorded in the Sites and Monuments database and the true position of the scheduled mounds, reveals some variation (fig. 11). With a few exceptions, the positions of the mounds are marked on the cadastral maps with remarkable precision (fig. 12). The present review yielded the location of 4875 burial mounds, 1785 of which were unknown – or rather had been forgotten – prior to this study, i.e. a 26% increase relative to the data in Sites and Monuments. The mound signatures absent from many of the maps indicate that the number of mounds must be considered an absolute minimum.The Venn diagram (fig. 14) shows that 2320 mounds are marked on both historical maps and included in the Sites and Monuments database, while 1689 mounds are only marked on the cadastral maps. The rediscovered mounds and known mounds are not evenly distributed relative to the land-use indicated on the Royal Academy of Sciences and Letters’ manuscript maps (fig. 15). These maps date from the late 18th century and show that more than half of the dry-land areas were used for agricultural purposes, while approximately one third was covered with heath. According to the historical maps, the majority of the known mounds in the Sites and Monuments database are situated on heathland, while only 30.6% are evident in agricultural areas. The rediscovered mounds are spread evenly across agricultural land and heath. If we turn our attention to the total number of burial mounds, heath areas are still over-represented. The differences between the percentages of land-use and the percentages of known burial mounds have come closer to equalisation with this study. This shows that mounds located near the farms would be at greater threat than those located on the outer margin of the fields. This is illustrated by the distance from the burial mounds to the boundary of the nearest settlement (fig. 16). According to figure 18, the lack of mounds in old agricultural areas results from a combination of land-use and the distance to historical farmsteads. A large proportion of the rediscovered mounds were positioned in the fields around old villages and they had been destroyed prior to the district surveys of the late 19th century. All the sources reveal a low occurrence of mounds in historical forests. This can be explained to some degree by the ancient forest ",2015,1,0,10.7146/kuml.v64i64.24218,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/836de52cda0e542defa62c8b4d27617d0b6244a6,Review,Kuml

These systems have common features which often includes an action by an “actuator” interacting with a target. While simulations and measurements exist for the success rate of hitting targets by some systems, there is a dearth of analytic models which can give insight into, and guidance on optimization, of new robotic systems. The present paper develops a simple model for estimation of the success rate for hitting random targets from a moving platform. The model has two main dimensionless parameters: the ratio of actuator spacing to target diameter; and the ratio of platform distance moved (between actuator “firings”) to the target diameter. It is found that regions of parameter space having specified high success are described by simple equations, providing guidance on design. The role of a “cost function” is introduced which, when minimized, provides optimization of design, operating, and risk mitigation costs.",2015,1,0,10.3390/s151129346,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5de2885c554d39010430ea32b2f678f680a55644,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

For this application, we evaluate both purely software-based implementations on different embedded processors, as well as implementations which feature dedicated peripherals for image processing implemented in FPGA. All of the implementations feature agent capabilities provided through the JADE Framework. The proposed Reconfigurable hardware Agent framework features capabilities which allow it to offer high performance for applications such as high resolution image processing. We consider the impact of JADE agent migration to an FPGA platform and evaluate the impact of partially reconfiguring the FPGA in this application. The proposed framework is evaluated in an application of use of UAVs for precision agriculture. A faster execution for the image processing algorithms and detection of points of interest (POI) allows for processing images of higher resolution, which may help the accuracy of POI detection. It may also allow for processing an increased number of images in real-time or improve the autonomy of the UAVs.",2015,0,0,10.1007/978-3-319-90023-0_2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b53bf8f5cc08fe74b2396b56301ce708112f89e,JournalArticle,International Conference on Exploring Services Science

It can efficiently lower the labor consumption and exert a positive impact on farmlands through wireless sensor networks. It can precisely acquire data on crops and the environment to achieve the scientific cultivation and management of the production equipment by means of automation, intelligence, and remote control and to advance the transformation of agricultural development in modern times. An intelligent system of high precision, which is based on the IOT, is formulated in this study. Such system applies Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) as its built-in gateway, with such carriers as Bluetooth, 2.4 GHz, Zigbee, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Wi-Fi, and others, to establish wireless sensor networks and manage the agricultural production through remote control and intelligent management.

5f31d7512d7819da83e84abbc555d71ac36c57f2,3D Maize Plant Reconstruction Based on Georeferenced Overlapping LiDAR Point Clouds,"3D crop reconstruction with a high temporal resolution and by the use of non-destructive measuring technologies can support the automation of plant phenotyping processes. Thereby, the availability of such 3D data can give valuable information about the plant development and the interaction of the plant genotype with the environment. This article presents a new methodology for georeferenced 3D reconstruction of maize plant structure. For this purpose a total station, an IMU, and several 2D LiDARs with different orientations were mounted on an autonomous vehicle. By the multistep methodology presented, based on the application of the ICP algorithm for point cloud fusion, it was possible to perform the georeferenced point clouds overlapping. The overlapping point cloud algorithm showed that the aerial points (corresponding mainly to plant parts) were reduced to 1.5%–9% of the total registered data. The remaining were redundant or ground points. Through the inclusion of different LiDAR point of views of the scene, a more realistic representation of the surrounding is obtained by the incorporation of new useful information but also of noise. The use of georeferenced 3D maize plant reconstruction at different growth stages, combined with the total station accuracy could be highly useful when performing precision agriculture at the crop plant level.",2015,78,3,10.3390/rs71215870,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f31d7512d7819da83e84abbc555d71ac36c57f2,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

85b8033cf782110c287a4443c23d2f42f595795d,The Genome Editing Revolution in Livestock Marches on,"Genome editing technology is taking the world by storm, no more so than in its application in livestock. The opportunities for both beneficial biomedical and agricultural applications abound. Although most transgenic livestock have been made using somatic cell nuclear transfer, the advent of genome editing technology initially ZFNs, then TALEN and now CRISPR/Cas9 engineered nuclease systems has brought back into favor the zygote (fertilized egg) injection route. Initial studies of genome editor delivery to zygotes in pigs focused on non-homologous end joining (Lillico et al., Sci Rep 10(3): 2847, 2013). In this form of genome editing, insertions or deletions (indels) are produced at the target site. The location of the editing event is specific but the indel is random. A more elegant use or genome editing technology is to cause a sequence change at precisely the desired genetic locus through homology-directed repair (HDR). In this issue, Zhou et al (Hum Mutat 37:110–118, 2016) report the first demonstration of CRISPR/Cas9 HDR by zygote injection in pigs. They achieve this through the use of a single-stranded DNA oligo (ssODN) carrying a point mutation within exon 2 of the pig SOX10 gene which would result in an arginine to tryptophan exchange (Arg106Try) in encoded amino acid (an allele swap) and this is what they detected. Mosaicism of the editing event was detected, with the majority of founder animals displaying at least three sequence traces for the target locus and in no cases were biallelic HDR events detected. The introduced SOX10 mutation is associated with clinical symptoms of hearing loss and pigmentation disturbance in human patients. The founder animals did show some alteration in pigmentation, however, it will take more detailed study to determine if these animals do indeed represent a reliable model of the human condition. Regardless, the study by Zhou and colleagues exemplify the utility and precision of genome editing technology for HDR in livestock. Their intention is to add to the growing interest in engineered large animal models of human disease, to accelerate disease mitigation strategies from the bench to the bedside.",2016,0,0,10.1002/humu.22861,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/85b8033cf782110c287a4443c23d2f42f595795d,"LettersAndComments,JournalArticle",Human Mutation

This paper proposes a new method to address the instability of small sample sizes in the successive projections algorithm (SPA) as well as the lack of association between selected variables and the analyte. The proposed method is an evaluated bootstrap ensemble SPA method (EBSPA) based on a variable evaluation index (EI) for variable selection, and is applied to the quantitative prediction of alcohol concentrations in liquor using NIR sensor. In the experiment, the proposed EBSPA with three kinds of modeling methods are established to test their performance. In addition, the proposed EBSPA combined with partial least square is compared with other state-of-the-art variable selection methods. The results show that the proposed method can solve the defects of SPA and it has the best generalization performance and stability. Furthermore, the physical meaning of the selected variables from the near infrared sensor data is clear, which can effectively reduce the variables and improve their prediction accuracy.",2016,13,0,10.3390/s16010089,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87605d0ff3b58844e1964a41f5fa282de9c69ad7,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors
bb128ade071c9279f0b1d94e0ff9209496d4e120,Building SDN-Based Agricultural Vehicular Sensor Networks Based on Extended Open vSwitch,"Software-defined vehicular sensor networks in agriculture, such as autonomous vehicle navigation based on wireless multi-sensor networks, can lead to more efficient precision agriculture. In SDN-based vehicle sensor networks, the data plane is simplified and becomes more efficient by introducing a centralized controller. However, in a wireless environment, the main controller node may leave the sensor network due to the dynamic topology change or the unstable wireless signal, leaving the rest of network devices without control, e.g., a sensor node as a switch may forward packets according to stale rules until the controller updates the flow table entries. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel SDN-based vehicular sensor networks architecture which can minimize the performance penalty of controller connection loss. We achieve this by designing a connection state detection and self-learning mechanism. We build prototypes based on extended Open vSwitch and Ryu. The experimental results show that the recovery time from controller connection loss is under 100 ms and it keeps rule updating in real time with a stable throughput. This architecture enhances the survivability and stability of SDN-based vehicular sensor networks in precision agriculture.",2016,16,3,10.3390/s16010108,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bb128ade071c9279f0b1d94e0ff9209496d4e120,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

We tested the hypotheses whether such measurements are capable to elucidate (1) differences in architecture that exist between genotypes; (2) genotypic differences between canopy height growth during the season and (3) short-term growth fluctuations (within 24 h), which could e.g. indicate responses to rapidly fluctuating environmental conditions. The canopies were scanned with a commercially available 3D laser scanner and canopy height growth over time was analyzed with a novel and simple approach using spherical targets with fixed positions during the whole season. This way, a high precision of the measurement was obtained allowing for comparison of canopy parameters (e.g. canopy height growth) at subsequent time points. Three filtering approaches for canopy height calculation from TLS were evaluated and the most suitable approach was used for the subsequent analyses. For wheat, high coefficients of determination (R2) of the linear regression between manually measured and TLS-derived canopy height were achieved. The temporal resolution that can be achieved with our approach depends on the scanned crop. For maize, a temporal resolution of several hours can be achieved, whereas soybean is ideally scanned only once per day, after leaves have reached their most horizontal orientation. Additionally, we could show for maize that plant architectural traits are potentially detectable with our method. The TLS approach presented here allows for measuring canopy height growth of different crops under field conditions with a high temporal resolution, depending on crop species. This method will enable advances in automated phenotyping for breeding and precision agriculture applications. In future studies, the TLS method can be readily applied to detect the effects of plant stresses such as drought, limited nutrient availability or compacted soil on different genotypes or on spatial variance in fields.",2016,108,8,10.1186/s13007-016-0109-7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fc8a385a250fc68d33a36b876fc2e0ce645bb18,JournalArticle,Plant Methods
45130402ca2e5d51db09de9612d20047f22db08f,Data Mining and NIR Spectroscopy in Viticulture: Applications for Plant Phenotyping under Field Conditions,"Plant phenotyping is a very important topic in agriculture. In this context, data mining strategies may be applied to agricultural data retrieved with new non-invasive devices, with the aim of yielding useful, reliable and objective information. This work presents some applications of machine learning algorithms along with in-field acquired NIR spectral data for plant phenotyping in viticulture, specifically for grapevine variety discrimination and assessment of plant water status. Support vector machine (SVM), rotation forests and M5 trees models were built using NIR spectra acquired in the field directly on the adaxial side of grapevine leaves, with a non-invasive portable spectrophotometer working in the spectral range between 1600 and 2400 nm. The ν-SVM algorithm was used for the training of a model for varietal classification. The classifiers’ performance for the 10 varieties reached, for cross- and external validations, the 88.7% and 92.5% marks, respectively. For water stress assessment, the models developed using the absorbance spectra of six varieties yielded the same determination coefficient for both cross- and external validations (R2 = 0.84; RMSEs of 0.164 and 0.165 MPa, respectively). Furthermore, a variety-specific model trained only with samples of Tempranillo from two different vintages yielded R2 = 0.76 and RMSE of 0.16 MPa for cross-validation and R2 = 0.79, RMSE of 0.17 MPa for external validation. These results show the power of the combined use of data mining and non-invasive NIR sensing for in-field grapevine phenotyping and their usefulness for the wine industry and precision viticulture implementations.",2016,41,1,10.3390/s16020236,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45130402ca2e5d51db09de9612d20047f22db08f,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

f22e5059bbb1cecb30665f8c60369c3e6b20b130,Localization and Classification of Paddy Field Pests using a Saliency Map and Deep Convolutional Neural Network,"We present a pipeline for the visual localization and classification of agricultural pest insects by computing a saliency map and applying deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) learning. First, we used a global contrast region-based approach to compute a saliency map for localizing pest insect objects. Bounding squares containing targets were then extracted, resized to a fixed size and used to construct a large standard database called Pest ID. This database was then utilized for self-learning of local image features which were, in turn, used for classification by DCNN. DCNN learning optimized the critical parameters, including size, number and convolutional stride of local receptive fields, dropout ratio and the final loss function. To demonstrate the practical utility of using DCNN, we explored different architectures by shrinking depth and width and found effective sizes that can act as alternatives for practical applications. On the test set of paddy field images, our architectures achieved a mean Accuracy Precision (mAP) of 0.951, a significant improvement over previous methods.",2016,172,11,10.1038/srep20410,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f22e5059bbb1cecb30665f8c60369c3e6b20b130,JournalArticle,Scientific Reports
c34a0d08e33a5b99c451193d6e30a39587ffc09e,Quantifying the legacy of the Chinese Neolithic on the maternal genetic heritage of Taiwan and Island Southeast Asia,"There has been a long-standing debate concerning the extent to which the spread of Neolithic ceramics and Malay-Polynesian languages in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) were coupled to an agriculturally driven demic dispersal out of Taiwan 4000 years ago (4 ka). We previously addressed this question using founder analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-region sequences to identify major lineage clusters most likely to have dispersed from Taiwan into ISEA, proposing that the dispersal had a relatively minor impact on the extant genetic structure of ISEA, and that the role of agriculture in the expansion of the Austronesian languages was therefore likely to have been correspondingly minor. Here we test these conclusions by sequencing whole mtDNAs from across Taiwan and ISEA, using their higher chronological precision to resolve the overall proportion that participated in the “out-of-Taiwan” mid-Holocene dispersal as opposed to earlier, postglacial expansions in the Early Holocene. We show that, in total, about 20 % of mtDNA lineages in the modern ISEA pool result from the “out-of-Taiwan” dispersal, with most of the remainder signifying earlier processes, mainly due to sea-level rises after the Last Glacial Maximum. Notably, we show that every one of these founder clusters previously entered Taiwan from China, 6–7 ka, where rice-farming originated, and remained distinct from the indigenous Taiwanese population until after the subsequent dispersal into ISEA.",2016,38,1,10.1007/s00439-016-1640-3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c34a0d08e33a5b99c451193d6e30a39587ffc09e,JournalArticle,Human Genetics
