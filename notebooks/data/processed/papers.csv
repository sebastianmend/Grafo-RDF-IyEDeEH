However, a rising demand for food and an increase in efficient farm practices has changed this, leading to a rise in precision farming technologies. Now, entities that provide services or information to farmers need precision farming technologies to compete, and more farmers are adopting precision farming technologies.

Indeed, we focus on the design of wireless sensing nodes and programming of the data transfer protocol for wireless sensing nodes (from the PHYSICAL layer to MAC layer) Experimental results show that the designed wireless sensing modules have the potential for real-world application with read-range (over 150 m), RSSI (bigger than –80 dBm), LQI (bigger than 108) and PRR (over 99%) in the range between 0 and 150 m.",2018,14,0,10.1080/24751839.2017.1390653,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fac9e5b32c67b4c1008f258aac491d37a259a2ae,JournalArticle,Journal of Information and Telecommunication
ccc20d914b695d726d8fa4766051e6b1f9e583a9,Real-Time Monitoring of Soil Compaction Using Piezoceramic-Based Embeddable Transducers and Wavelet Packet Analysis,"Quantitative assessment of soil compaction is of great importance to construction work, precision agriculture, and geotechnical research. Currently, measurement of soil compaction is mainly performed through field measurements, and the accuracy is highly influenced by personnel experience. In addition, most of the current methods for soil compaction measurement are capable of real-time monitoring. This paper presents an exploratory study of using a piezoceramic-based active sensing approach coupled with wavelet packet analysis to quantitatively monitor soil compaction in real time. In the active sensing approach, a pair of smart aggregates (SA) consisting of piezoceramic transducers embedded inside a host material are embedded into soil. In the pair, one SA acts as transmitter to transmit a modulated stress wave towards the other SA, which acts as receiver. The attenuation ratio of the stress wave propagating energy in soil is governed by the degree of soil compaction, so that the received wave properties of the smart aggregate sensor can be further characterized by using wavelet packet as an index to evaluate the soil compaction in real time. Integrated with remote sensing technologies, the proposed method has potential to be utilized as a real-time remote-sensing technology, which can offer a solution in the monitoring the degree of soil compaction.",2018,31,0,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2790902,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ccc20d914b695d726d8fa4766051e6b1f9e583a9,JournalArticle,IEEE Access
fbd1b95521dcce9765bff22bc72027ac08c80eec,CAN THE PEAT THICKNESS CLASSES BE ESTIMATED FROM LAND COVER TYPE APPROACH,"Indonesia has been known as a home of the tropical peatlands. The peatlands are mainly in Sumatera, Kalimantan and Papua Islands. Spatial information on peatland depth is needed for the planning of agricultural land extensification. The research objective was to develop a preliminary estimation model of peat thickness classes based on land cover approach and analyse its applicability using Landsat 8 image. Ground data, including land cover, location and thickness of peat, were obtained from various surveys and peatlands potential map (Geology Map and Wetlands Peat Map). The land cover types were derived from Landsat 8 image. All data were used to build an initial model for estimating peat thickness classes in Merauke Regency. A table of relationships among land cover types, peat potential areas and peat thickness classes were made using ground survey data and peatlands potential maps of that were best suited to ground survey data. Furthermore, the table was used to determine peat thickness classes using land cover information produced from Landsat 8 image. The results showed that the estimated peat thickness classes in Merauke Regency consist of two classes, i.e., very shallow peatlands and shallow peatlands. Shallow peatlands were distributed at the upper part of Merauke Regency with mainly covered by forest. In comparison with Indonesia Peatlands Map, the number of classes was the two classes. The spatial distribution of shallow peatlands was relatively similar for its precision and accuracy, but the estimated area of shallow peatlands was greater than the area of shallow peatlands from Indonesia Peatlands Map. This research answered the question that peat thickness classes could be estimated by the land cover approach qualitatively. The precise estimation of peat thickness could not be done due to the limitation of insitu data.",2018,4,0,10.30536/J.IJRESES.2017.V14.A2677,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fbd1b95521dcce9765bff22bc72027ac08c80eec,Review,

Modern frontier technologies involving systems approach towards efficient crop and input management, land and water use planning are essential for Indian agriculture to meet the challenges in the present context. Further, increasing the productivity level of a pollution free technological factor of production is inevitable. With this concern the present study was carried out in North Eastern parts of Karnataka state, where the precision farming technology was implemented. Hence, an attempt has been made through present paper to study the extent of usage of precision farming technologies at farm level. The technologies implemented were GPS, GIS, variable rate applications of inputs, crop sensors etc. Adopters were aware of benefits of management aspects like size of grid, soil sampling, soil analysis, variable rate of application of fertilizers, laser levelling and harvesting by grids. But still, precision farming has yet to take its firm ground in India by moving from its infant stage. This is possible by dissemination of technology and its benefits by bringing awareness among farming community through efforts of Department of Agriculture by using SAUs and NGOs as channels.",2018,2,0,10.18805/IJARE.A-4889,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0ef708d83f17d7a3bb9c68bd8241f7c2bc97a03,Review,

09eb76861ad91b8096fb6868c02476cadc97ce11,Research on the Effects of Drying Temperature on Nitrogen Detection of Different Soil Types by Near Infrared Sensors,"Soil is a complicated system whose components and mechanisms are complex and difficult to be fully excavated and comprehended. Nitrogen is the key parameter supporting plant growth and development, and is the material basis of plant growth as well. An accurate grasp of soil nitrogen information is the premise of scientific fertilization in precision agriculture, where near infrared sensors are widely used for rapid detection of nutrients in soil. However, soil texture, soil moisture content and drying temperature all affect soil nitrogen detection using near infrared sensors. In order to investigate the effects of drying temperature on the nitrogen detection in black soil, loess and calcium soil, three kinds of soils were detected by near infrared sensors after 25 °C placement (ambient temperature), 50 °C drying (medium temperature), 80 °C drying (medium-high temperature) and 95 °C drying (high temperature). The successive projections algorithm based on multiple linear regression (SPA-MLR), partial least squares (PLS) and competitive adaptive reweighted squares (CARS) were used to model and analyze the spectral information of different soil types. The predictive abilities were assessed using the prediction correlation coefficients (RP), the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP), and the residual predictive deviation (RPD). The results showed that the loess (RP = 0.9721, RMSEP = 0.067 g/kg, RPD = 4.34) and calcium soil (RP = 0.9588, RMSEP = 0.094 g/kg, RPD = 3.89) obtained the best prediction accuracy after 95 °C drying. The detection results of black soil (RP = 0.9486, RMSEP = 0.22 g/kg, RPD = 2.82) after 80 °C drying were the optimum. In conclusion, drying temperature does have an obvious influence on the detection of soil nitrogen by near infrared sensors, and the suitable drying temperature for different soil types was of great significance in enhancing the detection accuracy.",2018,17,1,10.3390/s18020391,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09eb76861ad91b8096fb6868c02476cadc97ce11,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

63a5974928f49555300907a1d7aeb14decd0ae53,Review of intelligent sprinkler irrigation technologies for remote autonomous system,"Changing of environmental conditions and shortage of water demands a system that can manage irrigation efficiently. Autonomous irrigation systems are developed to optimize water use for agricultural crops. In dry areas or in case of inadequate rainfall, irrigation becomes difficult. So, it needs to be automated for proper yield and handled remotely for farmer safety. The aim of this study is to review the needs of soil moisture sensors in irrigation, sensor technology and their applications in irrigation scheduling and, discussing prospects. The review further discusses the literature of sensors remotely communicating with self-propelled sprinkler irrigation systems, distributed wireless sensor networks, sensors and integrated data management schemes and autonomous sprinkler control options. On board and field-distributed sensors can collect data necessary for real-time irrigation management decisions and transmit the information directly or through wireless networks to the main control panel or base computer. Communication systems such as cell phones, satellite radios, and internet-based systems are also available allowing the operator to query the main control panel or base computer from any location at any time. Selection of the communication system for remote access depends on local and regional topography and cost. Traditional irrigation systems may provide unnecessary irrigation to one part of a field while leading to a lack of irrigation in other parts. New sensors or remotely sensing capabilities are required to collect real time data for crop growth status and other parameters pertaining to weather, crop and soil to support intelligent and efficient irrigation management systems for agricultural processes. Further development of wireless sensor applications in agriculture is also necessary for increasing efficiency, productivity and profitability of farming operations.

0ec8dc47c2bd501b64c26341e647a2b542fe361e,A Holistic Approach to the Evaluation of the Montado Ecosystem Using Proximal Sensors,"The Montado is a silvo-pastoral system characterized by open canopy woodlands with natural or cultivated grassland in the undercover and grazing animals. The aims of this study were to present several proximal sensors with potential to monitor relevant variables in the complex montado ecosystem and demonstrate their application in a case study designed to evaluate the effect of trees on the pasture. This work uses data collected between March and June 2016, at peak of dryland pasture production under typical Mediterranean conditions, in twenty four sampling points, half under tree canopy (UTC) and half outside tree canopy (OTC). Correlations were established between pasture biomass and capacitance measured by a commercial probe and between pasture quality and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measured by a commercial active optical sensor. The interest of altimetric and apparent soil electrical conductivity maps as the first step in the implementation of precision agriculture projects was demonstrated. The use of proximal sensors to monitor soil moisture content, pasture photosynthetically active radiation and temperature helped to explain the influence of trees on pasture productivity and quality. The significant and strong correlations obtained between capacitance and pasture biomass and between NDVI and pasture nutritive value (in terms of crude protein, CP and neutral detergent fibre, NDF) can make an important contribution to determination of key components of pasture productivity and quality and implementation of site-specific pasture management. Animal tracking demonstrated its potential to be an important tool for understanding the interaction between various factors and components that interrelate in the montado ecosystem and to support grazing management decisions.",2018,12,0,10.3390/s18020570,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ec8dc47c2bd501b64c26341e647a2b542fe361e,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors
27567983fe6e218f86f002342afe382cca1e9cad,"Specim IQ: Evaluation of a New, Miniaturized Handheld Hyperspectral Camera and Its Application for Plant Phenotyping and Disease Detection","Hyperspectral imaging sensors are promising tools for monitoring crop plants or vegetation in different environments. Information on physiology, architecture or biochemistry of plants can be assessed non-invasively and on different scales. For instance, hyperspectral sensors are implemented for stress detection in plant phenotyping processes or in precision agriculture. Up to date, a variety of non-imaging and imaging hyperspectral sensors is available. The measuring process and the handling of most of these sensors is rather complex. Thus, during the last years the demand for sensors with easy user operability arose. The present study introduces the novel hyperspectral camera Specim IQ from Specim (Oulu, Finland). The Specim IQ is a handheld push broom system with integrated operating system and controls. Basic data handling and data analysis processes, such as pre-processing and classification routines are implemented within the camera software. This study provides an introduction into the measurement pipeline of the Specim IQ as well as a radiometric performance comparison with a well-established hyperspectral imager. Case studies for the detection of powdery mildew on barley at the canopy scale and the spectral characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants grown under stressed and non-stressed conditions are presented.",2018,188,10,10.3390/s18020441,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27567983fe6e218f86f002342afe382cca1e9cad,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

6d7b34023f55afb0f17e009087329fad75d7b4c9,"A Novel Strategy for Very-Large-Scale Cash-Crop Mapping in the Context of Weather-Related Risk Assessment, Combining Global Satellite Multispectral Datasets, Environmental Constraints, and In Situ Acquisition of Geospatial Data","Cash crops are agricultural crops intended to be sold for profit as opposed to subsistence crops, meant to support the producer, or to support livestock. Since cash crops are intended for future sale, they translate into large financial value when considered on a wide geographical scale, so their production directly involves financial risk. At a national level, extreme weather events including destructive rain or hail, as well as drought, can have a significant impact on the overall economic balance. It is thus important to map such crops in order to set up insurance and mitigation strategies. Using locally generated data—such as municipality-level records of crop seeding—for mapping purposes implies facing a series of issues like data availability, quality, homogeneity, etc. We thus opted for a different approach relying on global datasets. Global datasets ensure homogeneity and availability of data, although sometimes at the expense of precision and accuracy. A typical global approach makes use of spaceborne remote sensing, for which different land cover classification strategies are available in literature at different levels of cost and accuracy. We selected the optimal strategy in the perspective of a global processing chain. Thanks to a specifically developed strategy for fusing unsupervised classification results with environmental constraints and other geospatial inputs including ground-based data, we managed to obtain good classification results despite the constraints placed. The overall production process was composed using “good-enough"" algorithms at each step, ensuring that the precision, accuracy, and data-hunger of each algorithm was commensurate to the precision, accuracy, and amount of data available. This paper describes the tailored strategy developed on the occasion as a cooperation among different groups with diverse backgrounds, a strategy which is believed to be profitably reusable in other, similar contexts. The paper presents the problem, the constraints and the adopted solutions; it then summarizes the main findings including that efforts and costs can be saved on the side of Earth Observation data processing when additional ground-based data are available to support the mapping task.",2018,20,1,10.3390/s18020591,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d7b34023f55afb0f17e009087329fad75d7b4c9,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

In the past few decades, researchers have studied several cultures exploiting different parts of a plant. A similar study is performed for Soybean using leaf images. A rule based semi-automatic system using concepts of k
-means is designed and implemented to distinguish healthy leaves from diseased leaves. In addition, a diseased leaf is classified into one of the three categories (
 downy mildew
, frog eye
, and Septoria leaf blight
). Experiments are performed by separately utilising colour features, texture features, and their combinations to train three models based on support vector machine classifier. Results are generated using thousands of images collected from PlantVillage dataset. Acceptable average accuracy values are reported for all the considered combinations which are also found to be better than existing ones. This study also attempts to discover the best performing feature set for leaf disease detection in Soybean. The system is shown to efficiently compute the disease severity as well. Visual examination of leaf samples further proves the suitability of the proposed system for detection, classification, and severity calculation.",2018,171,12,10.1049/iet-ipr.2017.0822,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a55c2e38a71ecc0c5812e42c5a3e05b9ea1b44e3,JournalArticle,IET Image Processing

b737d127e0919e6470646a347e40869d10d985b5,Discontinuity in the Insect Assemblages of a Northern Lower Michigan Stream,"We assessed the physicochemical and biological continuity of a 2nd–4th order reach of the Little Manistee River in northern Lower Michigan. Contrary to typical woodland streams, the downstream sites of the river were covered with a dense riparian canopy, whereas the upstream sites were devoid of this canopy due to historical (≥10 ybp) agriculture. Other than slight changes in water temperature and dissolved oxygen, there were no appreciable differences in measured water physicochemistry between the canopied and non-canopied sites. The stream, however, appeared biologically discontinuous as indicated by lower shredder abundance and higher filtering collector abundance at the upstream (non-canopied) sites for both benthic macroinvertebrate and adult caddisfly assemblages. Benthic scraper abundance was, likewise, higher in the upstream sites. Our results suggest that changes in riparian canopy alone can lead to changes in biological assemblages, even without obvious changes in water physicochemistry. ____________________ The river continuum concept (Vannote et al. 1980) describes a predictable pattern of gradual changes in river morphometrics and organismal assemblages as width increases and the river interacts with its riparian corridor. Anthropogenic disturbances, however, may disrupt this continuum, particularly in small–medium streams (Pringle et al. 1993; Delong and Brusven 1993, 1998; Houghton 2006, 2007). Removal of the riparian canopy cover, for example, may cause a loss of coarse allochthonous input needed by invertebrate shredders (Sabater et al. 2000, Warren et al. 2007). Agricultural streams in particular have concentrations of sediment, nutrient, and fine organic matter input hundreds of times higher than undisturbed streams (Royer et al. 2004, Inwood at al. 2005). Riparian habitat loss, with subsequent increases in nutrient and sediment input, has been repeatedly found to be the most widespread stressor of streams in the U.S. generally, in the Plains and Lowlands region of the U.S., and in Michigan (Paulsen at al. 2008, Wang et al. 2008). It is difficult to separate the habitat loss and sediment input components of riparian disturbance, as they frequently occur together. Several recent studies of agricultural watersheds, however, have noted positive correlations between the amount of intact riparian vegetation and the biological diversity in the adjacent streams (Houghton 2004a, Rios and Baily 2006, Urban et al. 2006). More specifically, Houghton et al. (2011a) found that sites in a southern Michigan agricultural stream protected by riparian canopy had 3× the number of adult caddisfly species as sites without canopy, even though physicochemistry remained unchanged and typical of agricultural streams. These studies suggest the hypothesis that both riparian habitat loss and increases in sediment 3Department of Biology, 33 East College Street, Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, MI 49242.

The purpose of our study, therefore, was to test this hypothesis by observing the effects of riparian canopy loss on stream macroinvertebrate assemblages in a stream without obvious sediment input. Materials and Methods Study site. The Little Manistee River is located in the northwestern portion of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. It is approximately 100 km in length and drains a watershed of approximately 1100 km2 before draining into Lake Michigan. Over half of the watershed is officially protected by the Manistee National Forest and the Pere Marquette State Forest, and much of the remaining land is also undeveloped (Fig. 1). Due to its relatively undisturbed watershed and stable groundwater input, it is one of the coldest and most stable streams in the Lower Peninsula (Tonello 2005). It hosts potomadromous spawning runs of steelhead [Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum)], Chinook salmon [Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum)], and brown trout [Salmo trutta Linnaeus] from Lake Michigan, and contains breeding populations of brook trout [Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchell)] (Seelbach 1993). Although much of the watershed is protected, the headwaters of the Little Manistee are primarily composed of pasture and feral fields (Tonello 2005). From our observations, it has been ~10 years since the upper watershed was under active cultivation. Five sites were sampled on the Little Manistee during this study. Sites 1–2 were located in the non-canopied headwaters region and sites 3–5 were all within the forested State and National Forest land (Fig. 1). All 5 sites were Figure. 1.

All sites were upstream from major tributaries. Stream width ranged from 3 m (2nd order) in the upper sites to 10-12 m (4th order) at the lower sites. Determination of the extent of canopy cover was from aerial maps and visual inspection. Except for the occasional alder (Alnus sp.) along the banks, non-canopied areas of both streams were almost devoid of plants > 2 m in height within 100 m of either bank. Thus, the distinction between ‘canopied’ and ‘non-canopied’ sites was distinct enough that further quantification and precision were deemed unnecessary. Physicochemical sampling. Physicochemical measurements were made twice during June and once monthly from July through September 2011. Six sets of measurements were made from each site on each date. Conductivity (ECTestr Low, Eutech Instruments), pH (AccuMet AP61, Fisher Scientific), dissolved oxygen (YSI-55, YSI Environmental), and temperature (YSI-55, YSI Environmental) measurements were all made on-site. All measurements were made within 2 h of each other to minimize diel fluctuations. Benthic macroinvertebrate sampling. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled using Hess samplers with 0.3 m2 areas (Barbour et al. 1999). Six Hess samples were taken from each site of each stream within a diversity of habitats. Sites 1, 2, and 4 were sampled during May 2010 and sites 3 and 5 were sampled in May 2011. All benthic specimens were identified to the lowest identifiable taxon, typically genus, after Hilsenhoff (1995). Adult caddisfly sampling. Adult caddisflies were sampled using ultraviolet light traps, which consisted of an 8-watt ultraviolet light placed over a white pan filled with 70% ethanol. Each trap was placed within 2 m of a sampling site at dusk and retrieved approximately two hours later. By standardizing the time of collection, wattage of the light source, and size of collecting pan, the technique yielded quantitative samples of the nocturnally active caddisfly adults and allowed for comparisons between sites (Houghton 2004a). To standardize weather conditions, samples were collected only if the peak daytime temperature was > 22°C, dusk temperature was >13°C, and there was no noticeable wind or precipitation at dusk. Sampling occurred approximately bi-weekly during June and July 2011, the peak emergence period of caddisflies in northern Michigan (Houghton et al. 2011b), for a total of 5 samples from each site. All adult specimens were identified to species after Houghton (2012), except for females of Hydroptilidae, Hydropsychidae, and Polycentropodidae, which lack the characters necessary for doing so. Such specimens were not included in any analyses. Data analyses. Specimens of both benthic invertebrates and adult caddisflies were placed into trophic functional groups following Merritt et al. (2008). Algal piercers were considered gathering collectors in analyses. Mean percentages of the functional groups informative of stream condition at each site: scrapers, shredders, and filtering collectors (e.g., Allan 1995, Houghton 2007), were compared to each other by a one-way Analysis of Variance. Percentages were transformed through an ArcSine function before analysis (Zar 2007). Mean water physicochemical values were compared using a 2-way Analysis of Variance to determine differences between both sampling site and sampling day. Sampling sites were examined for patterns in their benthic macroinvertebrate and adult caddisfly assemblages with Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) using the program PC-ORD for Windows® (McCune and Grace 2002). The DCA analysis was performed on a two-dimensional data matrix of sampling sites by taxa relative abundance values. Relative abundances were determined by counting the number of specimens collected at each site and then coding 0 specimens as ‘0’, 1–10 as ‘1’, 11–100 as ‘2’, 101–1000 as ‘3’, and 1001–10,000 as ‘4’. Since data coding accounted for variation in specimen abundance between sites, it was a more powerful measure than simple presence or absence data (Feminella 2000, Houghton 2004a). Coding on a log10 scale mitigated the effects 3 Houghton et al.: Discontinuity in the Insect Assemblages of a Northern Lower Michi Published by ValpoScholar, 2013 34 THE GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST Vol. 46, Nos. 1 2 of outlier samples often associated with light-trapping data, as well as the influence of highly abundant species (Cao et al. 1997, Houghton 2004a, Houghton et al. 2011b).

Variable rate spraying of the canopy allows growers to apply adjusted volume rate of pesticides to the target, based on canopy size, and to apply plant protection products in an economical and environmentally sound manner. In the field of pesticide application, knowledge of the geometrical characteristics of plantations will guarantee a better adjustment of the dosage of the agrochemicals applied. This technology is integrated with intelligent real-time sensors, which have a high potential for agricul- tural precision spray applications. This book chapter presents the foundations and applications in agriculture of the primary systems used for real-time spray target detection of the geometrical characterization of tree plantations. Systems based on infrared, ultrasonic, light detection and ranging (LIDAR), and stereo vision sensors were discussed, respec- tively, on their performances to detect spray targets. Among them, laser scanners and stereo vision systems are probably the most promising and complementary techniques for achieving three-dimensional (3D) pictures and maps of plants and canopies.

b2f69dba4768f9aaa6b86eba7cd0ba0e707d21ce,Regional Caddisfly (Trichoptera) Indicator Species for Mid-Order Michigan and Minnesota Streams,"Nearly 150,000 caddisfly specimens representing 238 species were analyzed from 166 5–15m wide streams within Michigan and Minnesota to determine the characteristic indicator species of 5 previously-established regions of caddisfly biological diversity. Based on a combination of relative frequency and abundance, 35 of these species indicated a particular region or regions. Indicator species in forested regions constituted a balance of trophic functional groups, whereas indicator species from agricultural regions were dominated by filtering collectors. While it was difficult to determine if species were indicating natural habitat type or differences in anthropogenic disturbance, establishing indicator species now will render potential future changes to the fauna easier to evaluate. ____________________ Indicator species are those that define particular ecosystems or habitat types. Indicator values for species are determined by combining their relative frequency in an ecosystem with their relative abundance in that ecosystem into an overall indicator value (Dufrêne and Legendre 1997). Knowing indicator species is important for biological assessment because information about an ecosystem can be inferred from the species that are indicative of it, and because changes in indicator species populations will likely reflect changes in the ecosystem that might otherwise be difficult to detect. This note determines indicator values for caddisflies (Trichoptera) in the determined caddisfly regions of Michigan and Minnesota. Caddisflies are taxonomically abundant and ecologically diverse in nearly all types of freshwater ecosystems (Mackay and Wiggins 1979). These traits, coupled with their differing tolerances to various types of ecological disturbances, render caddisflies important in biological water quality monitoring (Dohet 2002). Michigan and Minnesota have both been rigorously sampled for adult caddisflies during the last 15 years using light traps (Houghton 2015). This technique consists of an 8 watt ultraviolet light placed over a white pan filled with ethanol and set near an aquatic habitat for 2 hours starting at dusk. While not intended to be an exhaustive technique, maintaining consistent bulb wattage, pan size, weather conditions, and time interval allows for quantitative comparisons between samples of the nocturnally active species (Wright et al. 2013). Based on 79 samples from Michigan and 87 from Minnesota, mid-order (5–15 m wide) streams of both states were previously ordinated into 5 distinct regions of caddisfly biological diversity, with latitude, stream gradient, and relative upstream habitat disturbance determined as the most important variables affecting overall caddisfly assemblages (Fig. 1) (Houghton 2015). These regions have higher value at partitioning the caddisfly fauna into distinct groups than do traditional landscape delineations such as watershed or biotic province and, thus, are the appropriate sampling units for caddisflies in the two states (Houghton 1Department of Biology, Hillsdale College, 33 East College Street, Hillsdale, MI 49242. david.houghton.hillsdale.edu. 1 Houghton: Regional Caddisfly (Trichoptera) Indicator Species for Mid-Order Published by ValpoScholar, 2015 94 THE GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST Vol. 48, Nos. 1 2 2003). The purpose of this note was to determine indicator values for the individual species that indicated these particular established regions. Michigan specimens were collected from 2009–2013 and are stored in the Hillsdale College Insect Collection. Minnesota specimens were collected from 1999–2001 and are stored in the University of Minnesota Insect Museum. Species were tested for their value as indicator species using Dufrêne and Legendre’s (1997) indicator species technique using the program PC-ORD for Windows (McCune and Medford 2006). This method determines a species’ indicator value based on a combination of the percentage of streams within a region that contain a particular species, and the average abundance of that species within each region divided by the average abundance of that species in all regions. Combining these frequency and abundance values yields an overall indicator value, which is expressed as a percentage of perfect indication. Thus, in order to be a significant indicator, a species needs to be common and abundant in some ecosystems but not in others. A monte carlo test determines the significance of determined indicator values (McCune and Medford 2006). A total of 148,238 specimens were analyzed in both states combined. Of the 238 species tested, 35 had significant indicator values for a particular region (Table 1). Several species indicated >1 region. Indicator species of streams in the Northern Great Lakes and Northern Forested regions were of a mix of trophic functional groups. This pattern was expected by the river continuum concept (Vannote et al. 1980), which predicts a balanced assemblage of trophic functional groups in mid-order streams. Conversely, indicator species were >80% filtering Figure 1. The 5 caddisfly regions of Michigan and Minnesota as determined by Houghton (2015) relative to geographic location and land use.

Agricultural disturbance is higher in these regions than it is in the Northern Great Lakes and Northern Forested regions (Fig. 1) (see Houghton 2007 for an in-depth discussion of land use in these regions). In the absence of historical data, it is difficult to determine if species in this note are indicating natural habitat type or differences in anthropogenic disturbance. While I suspect both factors have an important influence on caddisfly assemblages, indication of anthropogenic disturbance may be the more important use of these indicator species data going forward. In both prairie and forested habitats, a caddisfly assemblage characterized by filtering collectors has been shown to reflect agricultural disturbance of the surrounding watershed (Whiles et al. 2000, Gage et al., 2004, Houghton 2007). More specifically, streams of northwestern Minnesota changed during the increase in agricultural land use of 1950–1985 from those containing a balance of functional groups to those dominated by filtering collectors (Houghton and Holzenthal 2010). Now that characteristic indicator species have been determined for the 5 caddisfly regions of Michigan and Minnesota, any future changes to the assemblages would likely reflect changes in watershed integrity. Thus, by establishing the characteristic caddisfly indicator species of these regions now, any future changes to the fauna and associated watersheds can be evaluated with greater precision and confidence.",2018,1,0,10.22543/0090-0222.2313,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b2f69dba4768f9aaa6b86eba7cd0ba0e707d21ce,JournalArticle,Great Lakes Entomologist

Spatial heterogeneity in agricultural systems is recognised as an important source of variability to be investigated. In the evolution of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), patterns and processes that influence spatio-temporal dynamics in insect populations tend to assume more importance compared to the classical theory. Geostatistics represent a valuable tool to investigate the spatial pattern of insect populations and to support pest control. After an explana tion of the geostatistical analysis, in the present paper we provided an overview of practical applications in managing pests, focusing on fruit orchards and vineyards. The utility of geostatistical tools is illustrated with examples taken from field studies, with attention to the analysis of spatial patterns, monitoring schemes, use of traps, scale issues, precision targeting, and risk assessment maps.

Technical and environmental features are apparent and can be described with couple of quite logic positive effects and consequences. It is rather difficult to exactly identify economic proceeds that must especially be seen in producer’s final perception (net margin). Methodology of net margin calculation is complicated and sometimes not fully transparent. A new (proper) methodological approach has been conceived in the concept of ATMP (Agricultural Technology Management Program). The Program is meant to provide the art of work to the extension worker in formulating sound and exact technological advice based upon both the availability of technological information (particularly on machinery sets and agronomic requirements) and rapid economic (costs) calculations. The program demonstrates an attempt to put into practice the concept of “precision technology” based on precision machinery inputs, which reduces machinery input costs. Preceding field survey carried out in August–September 2003 supplied basic data for technologies design and economic calculations. Five different mechanized technologies were conceived as provided with various operations and inputs: (1) classic mechanized technology composed of all necessary soil preparation, seeding, cultivation and harvesting operations; (2) direct sowing as a form of the minimum tillage (no soil preparation operations); (3) classic mechanized technology with farmyard fertilizing, (4) classical mechanized technology with combined cultivation operations; (5) classical mechanized technology with green manure. All technologies have been designed using Czech currency. The economic appropriateness of the respective technologies has been judged according to the main parameters of the crop budget that were selected for export to the comparison table. The parameters included in the comparison table were displayed in chart form. This enabled a better comparison of different parameters of the technologies. The main economic indicators that have been considered are the gross and net margins and own market price per ton of the product.",2018,2,0,10.17221/4882-RAE,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d7045f11c611848ae1e2a2eeae37794d265b295a,Review,
c9eaf544fb207cba7ce1af1ce3e904464962e214,Improved Distance Power Inverse Ratio Method Based on Spatial Data Mining Technique,"Through deep analysis on the principles and theories of Distance Power Inverse Ratio Method (DPIRM) and study on methods of geostatistics, this paper proposes a new interpolation to solve inherent problems of traditional DPIRM. This new method uses the regionalized variable theory to mining geological data to get the parameters of spatial anisotropy spheroid, uses cross-validation methodology with artificial intelligence approach, such like genetic algorithm (GA), to get the optimal power exponent of DPIRM. Compared with methods of geostatistics, the new DPIRM method can avoid human interference in fitting the spatial variogram. Compared with methods of traditional DPIRM method, the new DPIRM can avoid the problems of isotropous and power exponent decided without objective evidences. After practical application in a large-scale copper open-pit, the result proves that IDPIRM with spatial data mining technology can improve interpolation precision effectively, and also ensures the reliability of results. Introduction Distance power inverse ratio method is a common spatial interpolation method. It is easy to understand and simple to calculate. And the result from its calculation is good enough in engineering practice, such as survey [1], reserves estimation [2,3], mine modeling[4,5], geographical information[6,7], soil science, agriculture, forestry, aerography[8], environmentology[9], which need to spatial analysis. Its results often used to confirm calculations of other interpolation ways, just like as Ordinary Kriging (OK), one of geostatistics methods. But there are still exist short natural endowments with Distance Power Inverse Ratio Method: only to consider spatial distances between points to be estimated and other points measured, and not to consider other aspects effects (for example, anisotropy of attributes spatial distribution); clustering effect of data distribution [10]; homocentric circle (alleged ox eye) phenomenon when it deals with noisy data, and so on like these. So precision and reliability of this method are badly affected [11]. On the other hand, Ordinary Kriging, another common interpolation method, also is not perfect. For example, the excessive smoothing problem in mine application [12, 13], complicated theory which is hard to understand, parameters selected subjectively and OK’s calculation process is cockamamie and fussy. All of above hinders those methods popularizing in mines and other fields. Can we find a simple to calculate, easy to understand, precision and reliability, method of geological spatial data interpolation? This paper proposes that spatial data must be done mining before to do interpolate, and brings and uses data mining idea into whole interpolation process. Only find the law of spatial data distribution by data mining technology, the results of interpolation could be precision and reliability. After study geostatistics methods, this paper finds the reason why OK’s output is better than Distance Power Inverse Ratio Method (DPIRM). The reason is that OK uses regionalization variable theory, as a data mining tool, to find the law of spatial data distribution, and to interpolate follows the law. Based on this, this paper also makes Improved Distance Power Inverse Ratio Method (IDPIRM) using regionalization variable theory to get the spatial data distribution, and avoiding the anisotropy problem of traditional DPIRM; using artificial intelligence as another data mining technique, just like Genetic Algorithm [14,15], to find the best power exponent of DPIRM",2018,0,0,10.12783/dtcse/aiie2017/18199,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c9eaf544fb207cba7ce1af1ce3e904464962e214,Review,

In melon leaves, D. dadantii produced multiple necrotic spots surrounded by a chlorotic halo, followed by necrosis of the whole infiltrated area and chlorosis in the surrounding tissues. The extent of these symptoms, as well as the day of appearance, was dose-dependent. Several imaging techniques (variable chlorophyll fluorescence, multicolor fluorescence, and thermography) provided spatial and temporal information about alterations in the primary and secondary metabolism, as well as the stomatal activity in the infected leaves. Detection of diseased leaves was carried out by using machine learning on the numerical data provided by these imaging techniques. Mathematical algorithms based on data from infiltrated areas offered 96.5 to 99.1% accuracy when classifying them as mock vs. bacteria-infiltrated. These algorithms also showed a high performance of classification of whole leaves, providing accuracy values of up to 96%.

57fe534a35d578e7db6077cccfe5b7ad4767793a,Leaf and Canopy Level Detection of Fusarium Virguliforme (Sudden Death Syndrome) in Soybean,"Pre-visual detection of crop disease is critical for food security. Field-based spectroscopic remote sensing offers a method to enable timely detection, but still requires appropriate instrumentation and testing. Soybean plants were spectrally measured throughout a growing season to assess the capacity of leaf and canopy level spectral measurements to detect non-visual foliage symptoms induced by Fusarium virguliforme (Fv, which causes sudden death syndrome). Canopy reflectance measurements were made using the Piccolo Doppio dual field-of-view, two-spectrometer (400 to 1630 nm) system on a tractor. Leaf level measurements were obtained, in different plots, using a handheld spectrometer (400 to 2500 nm). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was applied to the spectroscopic data to discriminate between Fv-inoculated and control plants. Canopy and leaf spectral data allowed identification of Fv infection, prior to visual symptoms, with classification accuracy of 88% and 91% for calibration, 79% and 87% for cross-validation, and 82% and 92% for validation, respectively. Differences in wavelengths important to prediction by canopy vs. leaf data confirm that there are different bases for accurate predictions among methods. Partial least square regression (PLSR) was used on a late-stage canopy level data to predict soybean seed yield, with calibration, cross-validation and validation R2 values 0.71, 0.59 and 0.62 (p < 0.01), respectively, and validation root mean square error of 0.31 t·ha−1. Spectral data from the tractor mounted system are thus sensitive to the expression of Fv root infection at canopy scale prior to canopy symptoms, suggesting such systems may be effective for precision agricultural research and management.",2018,52,4,10.3390/RS10030426,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57fe534a35d578e7db6077cccfe5b7ad4767793a,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

Modern sensor technologies are capable of covering large surfaces of earth with exceptional spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. Due to these features, hyperspectral imaging has been effectively used in numerous remote sensing applications requiring estimation of physical parameters of many complex surfaces and identification of visually similar materials having fine spectral signatures. In the recent years, ground based hyperspectral imaging has gained immense interest in the research on electronic imaging for food inspection, forensic science, medical surgery and diagnosis, and military applications. This review focuses on the fundamentals of hyperspectral image analysis and its modern applications such as food quality and safety assessment, medical diagnosis and image guided surgery, forensic document examination, defense and homeland security, remote sensing applications such as precision agriculture and water resource management and material identification and mapping of artworks. Moreover, recent research on the use of hyperspectral imaging for examination of forgery detection in questioned documents, aided by deep learning, is also presented.

4a528647b35ab83710ccb9687120b7b4380f2a41,Unsupervised Segmentation of Greenhouse Plant Images Based on Statistical Method,"Complicated image scene of the agricultural greenhouse plant images makes it very difficult to obtain precise manual labeling, leading to the hardship of getting the accurate training set of the conditional random field (CRF). Considering this problem, this paper proposed an unsupervised conditional random field image segmentation algorithm ULCRF (Unsupervised Learning Conditional Random Field), which can perform fast unsupervised segmentation of greenhouse plant images, and further the plant organs in the image, i.e. fruits, leaves and stems, are segmented. The main idea of this algorithm is to calculate the unary potential, namely the initial label of the Dense CRF, by the unsupervised learning model LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). In view of the ever-changing image features at different stages of fruit growth, a multi-resolution ULCRF is proposed to improve the accuracy of image segmentation in the middle stage and late stage of the fruit growth. An image is down-sampled twice to obtain three layers of different resolution images, and the features of each layer are interrelated with each other. Experiment results show that the proposed method can segment greenhouse plant images in an unsupervised method automatically and obtain a high segmentation accuracy together with a high extraction precision of the fruit part.",2018,29,2,10.1038/s41598-018-22568-3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4a528647b35ab83710ccb9687120b7b4380f2a41,JournalArticle,Scientific Reports
c48b7b60b264ba7516d8eb2b85e503ccdd6b4313,Estimation of vegetation indices for high-throughput phenotyping of wheat using aerial imaging,"Unmanned aerial vehicles offer the opportunity for precision agriculture to efficiently monitor agricultural land. A vegetation index (VI) derived from an aerially observed multispectral image (MSI) can quantify crop health, moisture and nutrient content. However, due to the high cost of multispectral sensors, alternate, low-cost solutions have lately received great interest. We present a novel method for model-based estimation of a VI using RGB color images. The non-linear spatio-spectral relationship between the RGB image of vegetation and the index computed by its corresponding MSI is learned through deep neural networks. The learned models can be used to estimate VI of a crop segment. Analysis of images obtained in wheat breeding trials show that the aerially observed VI was highly correlated with ground-measured VI. In addition, VI estimates based on RGB images were highly correlated with VI deduced from MSIs. Spatial, spectral and temporal information of images contributed to estimation of VI. Both intra-variety and inter-variety differences were preserved by estimated VI. However, VI estimates were reliable until just before significant appearance of senescence. The proposed approach validates that it is reasonable to accurately estimate VI using deep neural networks. The results prove that RGB images contain sufficient information for VI estimation. It demonstrates that low-cost VI measurement is possible with standard RGB cameras.",2018,95,6,10.1186/s13007-018-0287-6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c48b7b60b264ba7516d8eb2b85e503ccdd6b4313,JournalArticle,Plant Methods

Considerable progress has been made in the use of tools to routinely monitor and collect information from animals and farms in a less laborious manner than before. These efforts have enabled the animal sciences to embark on information technology-driven discoveries to improve animal agriculture. However, the growing amount and complexity of data generated by fully automated, high-throughput data recording or phenotyping platforms, including digital images, sensor and sound data, unmanned systems, and information obtained from real-time noninvasive computer vision, pose challenges to the successful implementation of precision animal agriculture. The emerging fields of machine learning and data mining are expected to be instrumental in helping meet the daunting challenges facing global agriculture. Yet, their impact and potential in “big data” analysis have not been adequately appreciated in the animal science community, where this recognition has remained only fragmentary. To address such knowledge gaps, this article outlines a framework for machine learning and data mining and offers a glimpse into how they can be applied to solve pressing problems in animal sciences.",2018,184,6,10.1093/jas/sky014,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f0ec43983a6e3aedd6e297fa94871116b401a07,JournalArticle,Journal of Animal Science

However, the literature lacks mechanisms for simulating smart communication protocols in precision agriculture for decreasing production costs. In this context, the current work presents an agent-based simulator of smart communication protocols for efficiently managing pesticides. The simulator considers the needs of electric power, crop health, percentage of alive bugs and pesticide consumption. The current approach is illustrated with three different communication protocols respectively called (a) broadcast, (b) neighbor and (c) low-cost neighbor. The low-cost neighbor protocol obtained a statistically-significant reduction in the need of electric power over the neighbor protocol, with a very large difference according to the common interpretations about the Cohen’s d effect size. The presented simulator is called ABS-SmartComAgri and is freely distributed as open-source from a public research data repository.

As a result of many years of domestication and selection for desired fruit quality, modern watermelon cultivars are susceptible to biotic and abiotic stress. The present review discusses how genetic selection and breeding combined with geospatial technologies (precision agriculture) may help enhance watermelon varieties for resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. Gene loci identified and selected in undomesticated watermelon accessions are responsible for resistance to diseases, pests and abiotic stress. Vegetable breeding programs use traditional breeding methodologies and genomic tools to introduce gene loci conferring biotic or abiotic resistance into the genome background of elite watermelon cultivars. This continuous approach of collecting, evaluating and identifying useful genetic material is valuable for enhancing genetic diversity and tolerance and combined with precision agriculture could increase food security in the Southeast.",2018,5,0,10.15835/NSB10110242,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/edd8c4c468eb9232c3580959f7fcc45adbccda8c,Review,

284a9cb0b78c17e60597fe92a3d3cca0d7487c13,A review of the use of convolutional neural networks in agriculture,"Abstract Deep learning (DL) constitutes a modern technique for image processing, with large potential. Having been successfully applied in various areas, it has recently also entered the domain of agriculture. In the current paper, a survey was conducted of research efforts that employ convolutional neural networks (CNN), which constitute a specific class of DL, applied to various agricultural and food production challenges. The paper examines agricultural problems under study, models employed, sources of data used and the overall precision achieved according to the performance metrics used by the authors. Convolutional neural networks are compared with other existing techniques, and the advantages and disadvantages of using CNN in agriculture are listed. Moreover, the future potential of this technique is discussed, together with the authors’ personal experiences after employing CNN to approximate a problem of identifying missing vegetation from a sugar cane plantation in Costa Rica. The overall findings indicate that CNN constitutes a promising technique with high performance in terms of precision and classification accuracy, outperforming existing commonly used image-processing techniques.

8c1b6573237c08d69bd586cb79276b1dafcd1ac3,A New Vegetation Segmentation Approach for Cropped Fields Based on Threshold Detection from Hue Histograms,"Over the last decade, the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has evolved significantly in different applications as it provides a special platform capable of combining the benefits of terrestrial and aerial remote sensing. Therefore, such technology has been established as an important source of data collection for different precision agriculture (PA) applications such as crop health monitoring and weed management. Generally, these PA applications depend on performing a vegetation segmentation process as an initial step, which aims to detect the vegetation objects in collected agriculture fields’ images. The main result of the vegetation segmentation process is a binary image, where vegetations are presented in white color and the remaining objects are presented in black. Such process could easily be performed using different vegetation indexes derived from multispectral imagery. Recently, to expand the use of UAV imagery systems for PA applications, it was important to reduce the cost of such systems through using low-cost RGB cameras Thus, developing vegetation segmentation techniques for RGB images is a challenging problem. The proposed paper introduces a new vegetation segmentation methodology for low-cost UAV RGB images, which depends on using Hue color channel. The proposed methodology follows the assumption that the colors in any agriculture field image can be distributed into vegetation and non-vegetations colors. Therefore, four main steps are developed to detect five different threshold values using the hue histogram of the RGB image, these thresholds are capable to discriminate the dominant color, either vegetation or non-vegetation, within the agriculture field image. The achieved results for implementing the proposed methodology showed its ability to generate accurate and stable vegetation segmentation performance with mean accuracy equal to 87.29% and standard deviation as 12.5%.",2018,61,4,10.3390/s18041253,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c1b6573237c08d69bd586cb79276b1dafcd1ac3,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors
aa9fb4d0d58d6265d283fe08cb4a4cf408ee99a1,Application of Deep Learning Architectures for Accurate and Rapid Detection of Internal Mechanical Damage of Blueberry Using Hyperspectral Transmittance Data,"Deep learning has become a widely used powerful tool in many research fields, although not much so yet in agriculture technologies. In this work, two deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), viz. Residual Network (ResNet) and its improved version named ResNeXt, are used to detect internal mechanical damage of blueberries using hyperspectral transmittance data. The original structure and size of hypercubes are adapted for the deep CNN training. To ensure that the models are applicable to hypercube, we adjust the number of filters in the convolutional layers. Moreover, a total of 5 traditional machine learning algorithms, viz. Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Bagging and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), are performed as the comparison experiments. In terms of model assessment, k-fold cross validation is used to indicate that the model performance does not vary with the different combination of dataset. In real-world application, selling damaged berries will lead to greater interest loss than discarding the sound ones. Thus, precision, recall, and F1-score are also used as the evaluation indicators alongside accuracy to quantify the false positive rate. The first three indicators are seldom used by investigators in the agricultural engineering domain. Furthermore, ROC curves and Precision-Recall curves are plotted to visualize the performance of classifiers. The fine-tuned ResNet/ResNeXt achieve average accuracy and F1-score of 0.8844/0.8784 and 0.8952/0.8905, respectively. Classifiers SMO/ LR/RF/Bagging/MLP obtain average accuracy and F1-score of 0.8082/0.7606/0.7314/0.7113/0.7827 and 0.8268/0.7796/0.7529/0.7339/0.7971, respectively. Two deep learning models achieve better classification performance than the traditional machine learning methods. Classification for each testing sample only takes 5.2 ms and 6.5 ms respectively for ResNet and ResNeXt, indicating that the deep learning framework has great potential for online fruit sorting. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of deep CNN application on analyzing the internal mechanical damage of fruit.",2018,128,8,10.3390/s18041126,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aa9fb4d0d58d6265d283fe08cb4a4cf408ee99a1,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in precision agriculture has great potential as a tool to analyze critical parameters in cultivation, among them the detection of planting failures. This letter presents a novel methodology for DF from aerial images, obtained using a UAV capable of collecting high-resolution RGB images.

Results show that the proposed DF method is reliable for accurately identifying failures over rows of planted coffee crops.",2018,49,2,10.1109/LGRS.2018.2819944,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a302852d3b36c1a1b0f0c0cb6bc20d300f30f20b,JournalArticle,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters
51a4698686ceb0560a9fa40d7fbfbb7a07805517,Effects of Heterogeneity within Tree Crowns on Airborne-Quantified SIF and the CWSI as Indicators of Water Stress in the Context of Precision Agriculture,"This research focused on understanding the effects of structural heterogeneity within tree crowns on the airborne retrieval of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI). We explored the SIF and CWSI variability observed within crowns of trees subjected to different water stress regimes and its effect on the relationships with leaf physiological measurements. High-resolution (20 cm) hyperspectral imagery was acquired to assess fluorescence retrieval from sunlit portions of the tree crowns using the Fraunhofer line depth method, and from entire crowns using automatic object-based tree crown detection methods. We also measured the canopy temperature distribution within tree crowns using segmentation algorithms based on temperature percentiles applied to high-resolution (25 cm) thermal imagery. The study was conducted in an almond orchard cultivated under three watering regimes in Cordoba, in southern Spain. Three airborne campaigns took place during the summer of 2015 using high-resolution hyperspectral and thermal cameras on board a manned aircraft. Relationships between SIF and the assimilation rate improved significantly when the sunlit tree crown pixels extracted through segmentation were used for all flight dates. By contrast, the SIF signal extracted from the entire tree crowns was highly degraded due to the canopy heterogeneity observed within tree crowns. The quartile crown segmentations applied to the thermal images showed that the CWSI values obtained were within the theoretically expected CWSI range only when the pixels were extracted from the 50th percentile class. However, the CWSI values were biased in the upper quartile (Q75) for all watering regimes due to the soil background effects on the calculated mean crown temperature. The relationship between the CWSI and Gs was heavily affected by the crown segmentation levels applied and improved remarkably when the CWSI values were calculated from the middle quartile crown segmentation (Q50), corresponding to the coldest and purest vegetation pixels (r2 = 0.78 in pure vegetation pixels vs. r2 = 0.52 with the warmer pixels included in the upper quartile). This study highlights the importance of using high-resolution hyperspectral and thermal imagery for pure-object segmentation extractions from tree crowns in the context of precision agriculture and water stress detection.",2018,43,0,10.3390/RS10040604,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/51a4698686ceb0560a9fa40d7fbfbb7a07805517,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

A wireless sensor can collect, analyze, and transmit measurements of its environment1,2. Currently, wireless sensors used in the IoT are predominately based on electronic devices that may suffer from electromagnetic interference in many circumstances. Being immune to the electromagnetic interference, optical sensors provide a significant advantage in harsh environments6. Furthermore, by introducing optical resonance to enhance light–matter interactions, optical sensors based on resonators exhibit small footprints, extreme sensitivity, and versatile functionalities7,8, which can significantly enhance the capability and flexibility of wireless sensors. Here we provide the first demonstration of a wireless photonic sensor node based on a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optical resonator, in which light propagates along the circular rim of such a structure like a sphere, a disk, or a toroid by continuous total internal reflection. The sensor node is controlled via a customized iOS app. Its performance was studied in two practical scenarios: (1) real-time measurement of the air temperature over 12 h and (2) aerial mapping of the temperature distribution using a sensor node mounted on an unmanned drone.

Printed electronics arises as an interesting alternative to fulfill this task due to the simplicity and speed to stamp electrodes on various surfaces. Within this context, the Fused Deposition Modeling 3D printing is an emerging, cost-effective and alternative technology to fabricate complex structures that potentiates several fields with more creative ideas and new materials for a rapid prototyping of devices. We show here the fabrication of interdigitated electrodes using a standard home-made CoreXY 3D printer using transparent and graphene-based PLA filaments. Macro 3D printed electrodes were easily assembled within 6 min with outstanding reproducibility. The electrodes were also functionalized with different nanostructured thin films via dip-coating Layer-by-Layer technique to develop a 3D printed e-tongue setup. As a proof of concept, the printed e-tongue was applied to soil analysis. A control soil sample was enriched with several macro-nutrients to the plants (N, P, K, S, Mg, and Ca) and the discrimination was done by electrical impedance spectroscopy of water solution of the soil samples. The data was analyzed by Principal Component Analysis and the 3D printed sensor distinguished clearly all enriched samples despite the complexity of the soil chemical composition. The 3D printed e-tongue successfully used in soil analysis encourages further investments in developing new sensory tools for precision agriculture and other fields exploiting the simplicity and flexibility offered by the 3D printing techniques.",2018,32,0,10.3389/fchem.2018.00151,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29d102ae845c16d88d5247a775bb6013407c60b3,JournalArticle,Frontiers in Chemistry
0720ab8a3e1cc11a02f2df067dc850791c198084,Assessing a mobile-based deep learning model for plant disease surveillance,"Convolutional neural network models (CNNs) have made major advances in computer vision tasks in the last five years. Given the challenge in collecting real world datasets, most studies report performance metrics based on available research datasets. In scenarios where CNNs are to be deployed on images or videos from mobile devices, models are presented with new challenges due to lighting, angle, and camera specifications, which are not accounted for in research datasets. It is essential for assessment to also be conducted on real world datasets if such models are to be reliably integrated with products and services in society. Plant disease datasets can be used to test CNNs in real time and gain insight into real world performance. We train a CNN object detection model to identify foliar symptoms of diseases (or lack thereof) in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). We then deploy the model on a mobile app and test its performance on mobile images and video of 720 diseased leaflets in an agricultural field in Tanzania. Within each disease category we test two levels of severity of symptoms - mild and pronounced, to assess the model performance for early detection of symptoms. In both severities we see a decrease in the F-1 score for real world images and video. The F-1 score dropped by 32% for pronounced symptoms in real world images (the closest data to the training data) due to a drop in model recall. If the potential of smartphone CNNs are to be realized our data suggest it is crucial to consider tuning precision and recall performance in order to achieve the desired performance in real world settings. In addition, the varied performance related to different input data (image or video) is an important consideration for the design of CNNs in real world applications.",2018,12,2,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0720ab8a3e1cc11a02f2df067dc850791c198084,JournalArticle,arXiv.org

This article develops a conceptual regulatory framework for small autonomous agricultural robots, from a practical, self-contained engineering guide perspective, sufficient to get working research and commercial agricultural roboticists quickly and easily up and running within the law. The article examines the liability framework, or rather lack of it, for agricultural robotics in EU, and their transpositions to UK law, as a case study illustrating general international legal concepts and issues. It examines how the law may provide mitigating effects on the liability regime, and how contracts can be developed between agents within it to enable smooth operation. It covers other legal aspects of operation such as the use of shared communications resources and privacy in the reuse of robot-collected data. Where there are some grey areas in current law, it argues that new proposals could be developed to reform these to promote further innovation and investment in agricultural robots.",2018,50,1,10.1007/s00146-018-0846-4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4de493b79505dd851d2012b90b8f7b2bc9bc6ff3,JournalArticle,Ai & Society
11124cc0d319e9d7e9c9c7fa8e44e9df973ddfb2,Modeling the Distributions of Brightness Temperatures of a Cropland Study Area Using a Model that Combines Fast Radiosity and Energy Budget Methods,"Land surface temperatures (LSTs) obtained from remote sensing data are crucial in monitoring the conditions of crops and urban heat islands. However, since retrieved LSTs represent only the average temperature states of pixels, the distributions of temperatures within individual pixels remain unknown. Such data cannot satisfy the requirements of applications such as precision agriculture. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model that combines a fast radiosity model, the Radiosity Applicable to Porous IndiviDual Objects (RAPID) model, and energy budget methods to dynamically simulate brightness temperatures (BTs) over complex surfaces. This model represents a model-based tool that can be used to estimate temperature distributions using fine-scale visible as well as near-infrared (VNIR) data and temporal variations in meteorological conditions. The proposed model is tested over a study area in an artificial oasis in Northwestern China. The simulated BTs agree well with those measured with the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). The results reflect root mean squared errors (RMSEs) less than 1.6 °C and coefficients of determination (R2) greater than 0.7. In addition, compared to the leaf area index (LAI), this model displays high sensitivity to wind speed during validation. Although simplifications may be adopted for use in specific simulations, this proposed model can be used to support in situ measurements and to provide reference data over heterogeneous vegetation surfaces.",2018,6,0,10.3390/RS10050736,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11124cc0d319e9d7e9c9c7fa8e44e9df973ddfb2,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

8655b372f5bc3bb40887d2983c9a790f23e2bb50,Performance Analysis of Network-RTK Techniques for Drone Navigation considering Ionospheric Conditions,"Recently, an accurate positioning has become the kernel of autonomous navigation with the rapid growth of drones including mapping purpose. The Network-based Real-time Kinematic (NRTK) system was predominantly used for precision positioning in many fields such as surveying and agriculture, mostly in static mode or low-speed operation. The NRTK positioning, in general, shows much better performance with the fixed integer ambiguities. However, the success rate of the ambiguity resolution is highly dependent on the ionospheric condition and the surrounding environment of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning, which particularly corresponds to the low-cost GNSS receivers. We analyzed the effects of the ionospheric conditions on the GNSS NRTK, as well as the possibility of applying the mobile NRTK to drone navigation for mapping. Two NRTK systems in operation were analyzed during a period of high ionospheric conditions, and the accuracy and the performance were compared for several operational cases. The test results show that a submeter accuracy is available even with float ambiguity under a favorable condition (i.e., visibility of the satellites as well as stable ionosphere). We still need to consider how to deal with ionospheric disturbances which may prevent NRTK positioning.",2018,12,1,10.1155/2018/5154697,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8655b372f5bc3bb40887d2983c9a790f23e2bb50,"JournalArticle,Review",J.

These platforms are flexible, easy to use and low-cost, and they are the best candidates for improving the farm efficiency and productivity. In this research, a guidance algorithm and a robust control system are combined to guarantee the robustness of the system to additive noise (i.e. wind disturbance) and uncertainties (i.e. model parameter variations). A small fixed-wing UAV with an autonomy of about $1$ hour is proposed as case study, to reduce the cost of monitoring and increasing the stability performance of the system. A waypoint-grid on a paddy field is verified by hardware-in-the loop tests.

c7b4ffad7cde136505fc2b4ef568684c15147a59,Technology-Assisted Decision Support System for Efficient Water Utilization: A Real-Time Testbed for Irrigation Using Wireless Sensor Networks,"Scientific organizations and researchers are eager to apply recent technological advancements, such as sensors and actuators, in different application areas, including environmental monitoring, creation of intelligent buildings, and precision agriculture. Technology-assisted irrigation for agriculture is a major research innovation which eases the work of farmers and prevents water wastage. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used as sensor nodes that directly interact with the physical environment and provide real-time data that are useful in identifying regions in need, particularly in agricultural fields. This paper presents an efficient methodology that employs WSN as a data collection tool and a decision support system (DSS). The proposed DSS can assist farmers in their manual irrigation procedures or automate irrigation activities. Water-deficient sites in both scenarios are identified by using soil moisture and environmental data sensors. However, the proposed system’s accuracy is directly proportional to the accuracy of dynamic data generated by the deployed WSN. A simplified outlier-detection algorithm is thus presented and integrated with the proposed DSS to fine-tune the collected data prior to processing. The complexity of the algorithm is O(1) for dynamic datasets generated by sensor nodes and O(n) for static datasets. Different issues in technology-assisted irrigation management and their solutions are also addressed.",2018,62,3,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2836185,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7b4ffad7cde136505fc2b4ef568684c15147a59,JournalArticle,IEEE Access

We introduce several conceptual innovations to the analysis of time-series data in the area of predictive GRNs. Our resulting network now provides the “transcriptional logic” for transcription factor perturbations aimed at improving N-use efficiency, an important issue for global food production in marginal soils and for sustainable agriculture. More broadly, the combination of the time-based approaches we develop and deploy can be applied to uncover the temporal “transcriptional logic” for any response system in biology, agriculture, or medicine. This study exploits time, the relatively unexplored fourth dimension of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), to learn the temporal transcriptional logic underlying dynamic nitrogen (N) signaling in plants. Our “just-in-time” analysis of time-series transcriptome data uncovered a temporal cascade of cis elements underlying dynamic N signaling. To infer transcription factor (TF)-target edges in a GRN, we applied a time-based machine learning method to 2,174 dynamic N-responsive genes. We experimentally determined a network precision cutoff, using TF-regulated genome-wide targets of three TF hubs (CRF4, SNZ, and CDF1), used to “prune” the network to 155 TFs and 608 targets. This network precision was reconfirmed using genome-wide TF-target regulation data for four additional TFs (TGA1, HHO5/6, and PHL1) not used in network pruning. These higher-confidence edges in the GRN were further filtered by independent TF-target binding data, used to calculate a TF “N-specificity” index. This refined GRN identifies the temporal relationship of known/validated regulators of N signaling (NLP7/8, TGA1/4, NAC4, HRS1, and LBD37/38/39) and 146 additional regulators. Six TFs—CRF4, SNZ, CDF1, HHO5/6, and PHL1—validated herein regulate a significant number of genes in the dynamic N response, targeting 54% of N-uptake/assimilation pathway genes. Phenotypically, inducible overexpression of CRF4 in planta regulates genes resulting in altered biomass, root development, and 15NO3− uptake, specifically under low-N conditions. This dynamic N-signaling GRN now provides the temporal “transcriptional logic” for 155 candidate TFs to improve nitrogen use efficiency with potential agricultural applications. Broadly, these time-based approaches can uncover the temporal transcriptional logic for any biological response system in biology, agriculture, or medicine.",2018,173,14,10.1073/pnas.1721487115,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04774891394a352b266e1d757655137518f42b62,JournalArticle,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

There are many works which have investigated the connection between photosynthetic parameters and PRI; however, their results varied and were sometimes contradictory. For this paper, we performed a meta-analysis of works in this field. Here, only linear correlations of PRI with photosynthetic parameters—including quantum yield of photosystem II (ΔF/Fm’), nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (NPQ), and light use efficiency (LUE)—were investigated. First, it was shown that the correlations were dependent on conditions of PRI measurements (leaf or canopy; artificial light or sunlight). Second, it was shown that a minimal level of the photosynthetic stress, and the variation of this level among investigated plants, can influence the linear correlation of PRI with ΔF/Fm’ and NPQ; the effect was dependent on conditions of measurements. In contrast, the distribution of LUE among plants did not influence its correlation with PRI. Thus, the meta-analysis shows that the distribution of photosynthetic parameters among investigated plants can be an important factor that influences the efficiency of remote sensing on the basis of the PRI measurement.",2018,50,3,10.3390/RS10050771,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aca26e8153ba47f32dc074d6357dea244873d933,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

In medicine, nanoscale drug delivery systems grant improved therapeutic precision by overcoming biological barriers and enhancing drug targeting to diseased tissues. Here, we loaded nanoscale drug-delivery systems with agricultural nutrients, and applied them to the leaves of tomato plants. We show that the nanoparticles – liposomes composed of plant-derived lipids, penetrate the leaf and translocate in a bidirectional manner, distributing to other leaves and to the roots. The liposomes were then internalized by the plant cells, where they released their active ingredient. Up to 33% of the applied nanoparticles penetrated the leaf, compared to less than one percent of free-molecules applied in a similar manner. In our study, tomato plants treated with liposomes loaded with Fe and Mg overcame acute nutrient deficiency which was not treatable using ordinary agricultural nutrients. Furthermore, to address regulatory concerns regarding airborne nanoparticles, we rationally designed liposomes that were stable only over short spraying distances (less than 2 meters), while the liposomes disintegrated into safe molecular building blocks (phospholipids) over longer airborne distances. These findings support expanding the implementation of nanotechnology for delivering micronutrients to agricultural crops for increasing yield.",2018,157,2,10.1038/s41598-018-25197-y,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/43093ad9773f74f6748ef5f071c175fbfece124c,JournalArticle,Scientific Reports

Legumes play an important role in cropping systems, by associating with rhizobia microbes that convert plant-unavailable atmospheric nitrogen into usable nitrogen through symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF). However, there can be field-level spatial variability for SNF activity, as well as underlying soil factors that influence SNF (e.g., macro/micronutrients, pH, and rhizobia). There is a need for PA tools that can diagnose spatial variability in SNF activity, as well as the relevant environmental factors that influence SNF. Little information is available in the literature concerning the potential of PA to diagnose/optimize SNF. Here, we critically analyze SNF/soil diagnostic methods that hold promise as PA tools in the short–medium term. We also review the challenges facing additional diagnostics currently used for research, and describe the innovations needed to move them forward as PA tools. Our analysis suggests that the nitrogen difference method, isotope methods, and proximal and remote sensing techniques hold promise for diagnosing field-level variability in SNF. With respect to soil diagnostics, soil sensors and remote sensing techniques for nitrogen, phosphorus, pH, and salinity have short–medium term potential to optimize legume SNF under field conditions.",2018,38,3,10.3390/AGRONOMY8050078,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f20e6ff2efc2ab8d9286fb2911a8296c83bb55b1,Review,

With a growing global population, the issues of improving the efficiency of agriculture have become most relevant. Farmers are looking for new ways to increase yields, and governments of different countries are developing new programs to support agriculture. This contributes to a more active implementation of digital technologies in agriculture, helping farmers to make better decisions, increase yields and take care of the environment. The central point is the collection and analysis of data. In the industry of agriculture, data can be collected from different sources and may contain useful patterns that identify potential problems or opportunities. Data should be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to extract useful insights.

Although many computer vision tasks have been successfully carried out with deep convolutional neural networks, there is a growing need to understand their large scale impact on building mapping with remote sensing imagery. Taking advantage of the scalability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and using only few areas with the abundance of building footprints, for the first time we conduct a comparative analysis of four state-of-the-art CNNs for extracting building footprints across the entire continental United States. The four CNN architectures namely: Branch-out CNN, fully convolutional network (FCN), conditional random field as recurrent neural network (CRFasRNN), and SegNet, support semantic pixelwise labeling and focus on capturing textural information at multiscale. We use 1-meter resolution aerial images from National Agriculture Imagery Program as the test-bed, and compare the extraction results across the four methods. In addition, we propose to combine signed-distance labels with SegNet, the preferred CNN architecture identified by our extensive evaluations, to advance building extraction results to instance level. We further demonstrate the usefulness of fusing additional near IR information into the building extraction framework. Large scale experimental evaluations are conducted and reported using metrics that include: Precision, recall rate, intersection over union, and the number of buildings extracted. With the improved CNN model and no requirement of further postprocessing, we have generated building maps for the United States with an average processing time less than one minute for an area of size  $\sim {\text{56}}$  $\text{km}^2$. The quality of extracted buildings and processing time demonstrated that the proposed CNN based framework fits the need of building extraction at scale.",2018,183,7,10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2835377,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77038e36e5c503bb191b9cfce7cc20c3f11e3d74,JournalArticle,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing

The environmental factors such as temperature-humidity and soil humidity are the key influencing factors on crop growth, therefore, how to rapidly and accurately acquire the environmental information of crop growth and learn about their real-time growing environment is of vital importance. The wireless sensor networks (WSN) can make real-time environmental information acquisition as well as communication and processing of network environmental data. Based on this, the RSSI range-based positioning method was optimized in this paper in order to greatly improve its precision. To be specific, in this study, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was firstly applied in the hybrid mutation strategy to make more accurate node positioning and significantly improve the evolutionary performance by enlarging the hunting zone; besides, through the use of WSN, the influencing parameters on crop growth such as soil humidity, and temperature-humidity etc. would be monitored; finally, to realize the precise location and derive the unseeded nodes, GPS was applied for accurate positioning, and the intelligence algorithm was adopted to determine the coordinate position of unknown nodes.

23bb5d4e08f0f65e998b9c9c440eb6ad45be2279,DTM GENERATION THROUGH UAV SURVEY WITH A FISHEYE CAMERA ON A VINEYARD,"Abstract. Precision agriculture recommends a sustainable employment of nutrients and water, according to the site-specific crop requirements. In this context, the knowledge of soil characteristics allows to appropriately manage resources. Even the topography can influence the spatial distribution of the water on a field. This work focuses on the production of high-resolution Digital Terrain Model (DTM) in agriculture by photogrammetric processing fisheye images, acquired with very light Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Particular attention is given to the data processing procedures and to the assessment of the quality of the results, considering the peculiarity of the acquired images. An experimental test has been carried out on a vineyard located in Monzambano, Northern Italy, through photogrammetric survey with Parrot Bebop 2 UAV. It has been realized at the end of the vegetation season, to investigate the ground without any impediment due to the presence of leaves or branches. In addition, the survey has been used for evaluating the performance of Bebop fisheye camera in viticulture. Different flight strategies have been tested, together with different Ground Control Points (GCPs) and Check Points (CPs) configurations and software packages. The computed DTMs have been compared with a reference model obtained through Kriging interpolation of GNSS-RTK measurements. Residuals on CPs are of the order of 0.06 m, for all the considered scenarios, that for agricultural applications is by far sufficient. The photogrammetric DTMs show a good agreement with the reference one.

d00d799bb902b5737e9c1aa922ada2b596ebff85,Deep Learning with unsupervised data labeling for weeds detection on UAV images,"In recent years, weeds is responsible for most of the agricultural yield losses. To deal with this threat, farmers resort to spraying pesticides throughout the field. Such method not only requires huge quantities of herbicides but impact environment and humans health. One way to reduce the cost and environmental impact is to allocate the right doses of herbicide at the right place and at the right time (Precision Agriculture). Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is becoming an interesting acquisition system for weeds localization and management due to its ability to obtain the images of the entire agricultural field with a very high spatial resolution and at low cost. Despite the important advances in UAV acquisition systems, automatic weeds detection remains a challenging problem because of its strong similarity with the crops. Recently Deep Learning approach has shown impressive results in different complex classification problem. However, this approach needs a certain amount of training data but, creating large agricultural datasets with pixel-level annotations by expert is an extremely time consuming task. In this paper, we propose a novel fully automatic learning method using Convolutional Neuronal Networks (CNNs) with unsupervised training dataset collection for weeds detection from UAV images. The proposed method consists in three main phases. First we automatically detect the crop lines and using them to identify the interline weeds. In the second phase, interline weeds are used to constitute the training dataset. Finally, we performed CNNs on this dataset to build a model able to detect the crop and weeds in the images. The results obtained are comparable to the traditional supervised training data labeling.

Machines can do automated tasks better, cheaper and faster. One can use the camera from the sky and measure things on the earth especially on cropland from drones and satellites. Over time, drones have increased in capabilities and fallen in cost, and their use has greatly expanded especially in complex terrain. High quality remote sensing with spectral imaging using drones makes them interesting for regular use in Precision Agriculture (PA). Drones are often used in agriculture in ways that were highly controversial only a short time ago even there are no unified legislation on drones usage in agriculture.

Changing conditions (e.g., different crops being grown), however, may require the occasional reconfiguration of the resulting networks of wireless sensors, e.g., to modify data reporting rates or synchronize internal clocks. In this demo we showcase an opportunistic broadcast channel to forward such configuration messages to embedded systems.

12c9afbb38fa6a1552302b5b4ee8697b08358822,PulseHV: Opportunistic Data Transmissions over High Voltage Pulses for Smart Farming Applications,"Wireless Sensor Networks establish the foundation for a revolution in precision agriculture. As an integral part of smart farming systems, they can collect detailed information about crop health, air and soil conditions, and other relevant parameters to support agriculturists in their decision-making. Likewise, decentralized actuation (e.g., opening sprinkler valves) becomes possible when embedded sensor and actuator devices are deployed. From a technical point of view, smart farming systems strongly rely on embedded devices with wireless communication interfaces to cater for their convenient deployment. The operation of their wireless radio transceivers, however, often represents a significant energetic burden. This is particularly conspicuous when compared to the low-power microcontrollers that have become ubiquitous on current-generation sensing systems. We mitigate this issue by following an entirely different approach in this work, namely by exploiting the presence of electric fence energizers that are widely used in farming scenarios. Our solution called PULSEHV modulates data onto the highvoltage electric pulses emitted by fence energizers and thus enables broadcast communications at no extra overhead. As electrical fences commonly encircle entire patches of cropland, they act as large sending antennas; a proximity between deployed sensing devices and this antenna is implicitly ensured thereby. We practically demonstrate how PulseHV accomplishes an effective data rate of 2.7 bit/s through the application of pulse position modulation. This limited throughput is counterbalanced by the fact that receiving the broadcast transmissions incurs virtually no energy overhead.",2018,3,0,10.1109/DCOSS.2018.00017,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12c9afbb38fa6a1552302b5b4ee8697b08358822,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems

It builds a tree like routing topology for the IP-enabled wireless sensor networks (WSN), commonly referred as lossy and low power network (LLN). This has been defined by the IETF for four main applications including home automation, industrial control, urban environment, and building automation. Recently, we have observed a growing interest for applying IoT to Precision Agriculture (PA). This field is especially characterized by high density of sensing nodes, large area WSN deployments, and intrinsic composition of the farmland from parcels and/or activity sectors. This usually leads to a heavy exchange of data messages, straightforwardly inducing network congestion, radio interference,latency issue, and high energy consumption. It is however important to note that in most precision agriculture cases, only aggregated data of each parcel or sector is effectively needed. In this context, applying in-network aggregation techniques will practically reduce the number of exchanged data messages; hence reducing the network load and energy consumption. In this work, we propose a new version of RPL protocol, named partition aware-RPL (PA-RPL). This builds up a routing topology that reflects the way the farmland is partitioned; therefore inherently enabling easy innetwork aggregation.

Today VRTs are available at reasonable costs and most of the platforms are able to apply a given rate in a given position by using a prescription map that is usually designed by an agronomist basing on historical data and scouting on the field. In this scenario several technologies are involved at different stages as the acquisition of data to take decision by using ground and/or aerial vehicles, data analytics to derive prescriptions and variable rate controller also aided by auto-steering to apply the desired quantity. This pipeline works if and only if all the stages are trustable. In particular, it is import to acquire data at different times in order to evaluate the best rate considering the phenological phase and the previous/current status. Aerial (unmanned) vehicles are currently used to map the status but for complex crops as vineyards, it is necessary to properly segment soil vs crop/tree. Moreover aerial images offer a partial view that in case of vineyards it is not sufficient considering that only upper canopy could be sensed. In this case, it is necessary to integrate top view with lateral ones that could be acquired also by using tractors during the application of treatments. In this paper we present an integrated approach where ground data are collected and processed in real-time also showing how these data could be integrated with aerial data. Data are collected by using LiDAR sensor and processed by a set of algorithms deployed as ROS nodes to estimate the volume and health of a plant/tree to support the creation of management zones.",2018,8,1,10.1109/ICUAS.2018.8453327,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4593b4c60a6e203ab460df4333a88425c57a13e1,Conference,International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems

This fine-grained costeffective pervasive sensing of thefarm is enabled with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) that have evolved into the modern realm ofInternet of Things (IoT). Sensor nodes installed as part of a WSN installation regularly send their measurements to a gateway that aggregates this information before sending it to the cloud. Open fields require energy and bandwidth efficient protocols for transmission and reportingof data as the power source is mostly restricted to solar. We propose an approach to achieve energy-efficient adaptive data collection from the network that involves development of an adaptive model for the gateway. The model uses crop-specific parameters to optimally configure itself to collect data from nodes in the network thereby maximizing energy-efficiency for the deployment. The optimization offered by our adaptive model is shown to achieve significant savings in energy (over 30%) in terms of number of messages exchanged at the gateway. This helps reduce unnecessary traffic to the cloud while extending the network lifetime.,2018,5,0,10.1109/GIOTS.2018.8534553,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/59b6e723850874d5e6dfdac4bee3cc4223af53be,JournalArticle,Global Internet of Things Summit

The main purpose of intelligent agriculture is to plan agricultural missions properly and use limited resources reasonably with minor human intervention. This paper proposes a Precision Farming System (PFS) as a Multi-Agent System (MAS). Components of PFS are treated as agents with different functionalities. These agents could form several coalitions to complete the complex agricultural missions cooperatively. In PFS, mission planning should consider several criteria, like expected benefit, energy consumption or equipment loss. Hence, mission planning could be treated as a Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP). In order to solve MOP, an improved algorithm, MP-PSOGA, is proposed, taking advantages of the Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization. A simulation, called precise pesticide spraying mission, is performed to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed approach works properly.

We propose a method for solving the CPP for disjoint areas. The general problem is modeled as a rural postman problem which has been demonstrated to be NP-Hard. Our solution relies on dividing the problem into two steps: optimization of the visiting order and optimization of the flight lines orientation. The method is validated through several simulations using real parameters. In addition, it is fast enough for being implemented onboard.",2018,46,4,10.1109/ICUAS.2018.8453386,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d064f7beca4108dab106521812aa28d1b9ec9f40,"Conference,Review",International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems

As the world's population is increasing more food production is required than ever before. But current methods that are used for agriculture are not sustainable to match up with the escalating demands. Advancement in methodologies is a big need. Hence as automation is done in different sectors, it can be applied to agriculture as well to provide a better tool for producing crop more proficiently.

These were acquired simultaneously with the same pixel size (4 m) over agricultural experimental site. The raw data were transformed to absolute ground reflectance using calibration coefficients and corrected atmospherically using MODTRAN-4. 2 radiative transfer code. As well, they were rectified geometrically. Then, pixels oriented classifications were carried out using the maximum likelihood algorithm, and objects oriented classifications with a hierarchical segmentation and nearest neighbor classifier. After segmentation, statistics comparison on the mean difference to neighbor objects confirmed that the segments had minimum mixing effects in respect to other segmentation levels and neighbor ing ground entities. Accuracy analysis has been done using a global and individual classes Kappa coefficients. The obtained results confirm that the objects oriented classification improve significantly (~ 8% ) the accuracy for individual crop classes comparatively to pixels oriented classification; also the global classification Kappa coefficient was improved with 5%, independently to the used sensor . Moreover, this study highlight the potential of hyperspectral data discrimination power for classification in precision agriculture generating unique spectral signatures, maximizing separability a nd distinguishing clearly among the considered classes.

Results suggest that younger, more educated producers, consulting farm dealers for information about PA technologies, using other PA technologies, and managing larger farming operations located in counties with more irregularly shaped fields are more likely to adopt ASC technologies and AG systems. Predicted adoption probabilities estimated using regression results suggest the use of other PA technologies and farm dealers as a source of precision farming information have the largest impact on the probability of adopting ASC by cotton farmers.

Based on the data accumulation of big data platform, the relationship between wheat growth and meteorology was taken as the research object. Thirteen variables including atmospheric pressure, temperature, light, and precipitation were extracted from surface meteorological data for correlation analysis, and temperature, precipitation, and sunshine were selected as the characteristic variables; through discretization processing, we have finally determined the three indicators that can be categorized: accumulative temperature, sunshine hours, and temperature. Finally, the three indicators are combined with months to build a model of farming season and weather based on Apriori. The results show that when judging the farming season with the month as the index, the accuracy of the model is between 78.81 and 100%.

4abb3db338fb5ced964f92059ddebfeb2d21a532,Fully Convolutional Networks With Sequential Information for Robust Crop and Weed Detection in Precision Farming,"Reducing the use of agrochemicals is an important component toward sustainable agriculture. Robots that can perform targeted weed control offer the potential to contribute to this goal, for example, through specialized weeding actions such as selective spraying or mechanical weed removal. A prerequisite of such systems is a reliable and robust plant classification system that is able to distinguish crop and weed in the field. A major challenge in this context is the fact that different fields show a large variability. Thus, classification systems have to robustly cope with substantial environmental changes with respect to weed pressure and weed types, growth stages of the crop, visual appearance, and soil conditions. In this letter, we propose a novel crop-weed classification system that relies on a fully convolutional network with an encoder-decoder structure and incorporates spatial information by considering image sequences. Exploiting the crop arrangement information that is observable from the image sequences enables our system to robustly estimate a pixel-wise labeling of the images into crop and weed, i.e., a semantic segmentation. We provide a thorough experimental evaluation, which shows that our system generalizes well to previously unseen fields under varying environmental conditions—a key capability to actually use such systems in precision framing. We provide comparisons to other state-of-the-art approaches and show that our system substantially improves the accuracy of crop-weed classification without requiring a retraining of the model.",2018,211,21,10.1109/LRA.2018.2846289,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4abb3db338fb5ced964f92059ddebfeb2d21a532,JournalArticle,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters

Through a weekly/biweekly airborne flight campaign, we acquired 10 mosaics with a micro-hyperspectral Vis-NIR imaging sensor ranging from 400–850 nanometres (nm). Just before harvest, 114 georeferenced grain samples were obtained manually. Using spectral exploratory analysis, we calculated narrow-band physiological spectral indices—normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) and ratio spectral index (RSI)—from every single hyperspectral mosaic using complete two by two combinations of wavelengths. We applied two methods for the multi-temporal hyperspectral exploratory analysis: (a) Temporal Principal Component Analysis (tPCA) on wavelengths across all images and (b) the integration of vegetation indices over time based on area under the curve (AUC) calculations. For GY, the best R2 (0.32) were found using both the spectral (NDSI—Ri, 750 to 840 nm and Rj, ±720–736 nm) and the multi-temporal AUC exploratory analysis (EVI and OSAVI through AUC) methods. For GPC, all exploratory analysis methods tested revealed (a) a low to very low coefficient of determination (R2 ≤ 0.21), (b) a relatively low overall prediction error (RMSE: 0.45–0.49%), compared to results from other literature studies, and (c) that the spectral exploratory analysis approach is slightly better than the multi-temporal approaches, with early season NDSI of 700 with 574 nm and late season NDSI of 707 with 523 nm as the best indicators. Using residual maps from the regression analyses of NDSIs and GPC, we visualized GPC within-field variability and showed that up to 75% of the field area could be mapped with relatively good predictability (residual class: −0.25 to 0.25%), therefore showing the potential of remote sensing imagery to capture the within-field variation of GPC under conventional agricultural practices.",2018,56,0,10.3390/rs10060930,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/514b861f72f3b809c1e09cc7ed6c5186ad53b529,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

93e9611ac5575cb2753459899470b09d3ae221f3,Small mammal responses to farming practices in central Argentinian agroecosystems: The use of hierarchical occupancy models,"Organic farming is more environmentally friendly than conventional agriculture, promoting greater levels of habitat heterogeneity. Field borders could be more suitable for biodiversity in agricultural anthromes. Small mammals are crucial in these anthromes due to their contribution to food webs and seed consumption. We used hierarchical multi-season occupancy models to assess the effect of organic versus conventional farming on multiple small mammal species in agricultural anthromes of central Argentina. We modelled detectability and increased precision of estimates, overcoming deficiencies of previous studies. Small mammals were seasonally surveyed in 70 field borders (conventional) and 63 (organic) during two years. We were able to include less frequent specialist species, detecting a positive relationship with organic management possibly because of higher habitat quality of borders. Vegetation volume was the most important explanatory variable in both managements. Species’ richness was greater under organic management mainly in spring when the habitat quality differences with conventional management were the greatest. Spring is key for the rodent assemblage because of the beginning of reproductive period, when resource demand is important. We suggest that maintaining high quality border habitats, as those supported by organic management, could allow farmers to obtain economic profit while also contributing to biodiversity conservation. Considering the positive role that native rodents may have in some agricultural anthromes, the maintenance of high population numbers may be important for biodiversity conservation. The approach used in this study shows the importance of modelling imperfect detection, reducing bias in parameter estimates, and it should be implemented in similar studies. Land use conversion to agriculture and pasturelands may alter not only the abundance of seed-eating animals but also their role as seed predators and dispersers. We investigated the effect of landscape changes, including areas under restoration process, on seed predation by native rodents in the Brazilian Cerrado, the most diverse savanna of the world. We evaluated seed predation of two tree species ( Tachigali vulgaris and Copaifera langsdorffii ; Fabaceae ) in five habitats: typical savanna (cerrado sensu stricto), abandoned pasture dominated by African grass Urochloa decumbens , and three environments representing distinct phases along an active restoration process (two, three, and four years after direct seeding of native species). We also evaluated rodent abundance in these areas. In captivity, we offered seeds of both species and of Urochloa decumbens to Necromys lasiurus ( Sigmodontinae ), the most abundant rodent in the study. Field tests with semipermeable exclosures indicated that small rodents were the main seed predators in all habitats. Only for Copaifera langsdorffii seed-predation rates differed among habitats, being higher during the rainy season in the native Cerrado and pasture. We captured 180 rodents belonging to five species, with a high dominance of Necromys lasiurus (ca. 95% of all individuals). Areas in more advanced regeneration process and native environments tended to show greater rodent richness, following plant community patterns. In captivity, Necromys lasiurus preyed upon all species offered. Our results suggest that the transformation of native areas in planted pastures and subsequent regeneration processes modify the abundance of small mammals in the Brazilian savanna but not their role as main seed predators. The abundance of this group is relevant for crucial ecological processes, such as seed predation Seed-rodent interaction has been recognized as one of the important components of the forest ecosystems. Seeds provide food to rodents which provide service of seed dispersal and regeneration. It is obvious that seed-rodent relation if composed of both predation and mutualism. Seeds tend to manipulate hoarding behavior of rodents to maximize the seed dispersal fitness by adopting a series of conflicting but well-balanced strategies of attraction and defense. Rodents tend to select seeds to maximize their fitness by adopting various hoarding behavior and seed management strategies. This reciprocal interaction would finally determine their ecological relationship shifting between predation to mutualism, and then the role of rodents in forest regeneration. Deforestation and forest fragmentation would greatly affect the seed-rodent interactions and then forest regeneration and health. There is a need to take actions of managing the seed-rodent interaction so as to facilitate recovery of degenerated forest ecosystems. Since middle 1990s, the seed-rodent interaction in six locations representing the tropical, sub-tropical, warm-temperate, temperate and cold-temperate climate zones have been carried out in China. This paper will present a review of research progresses on seed-rodent interactions in China. Rodents influence plant establishment and regeneration by functioning as both seed predators and dispersers. However, these rodent-plant interactions can vary significantly due to various environmental conditions and the activity of other insect seed-predators. Here, we use a combination of both field and enclosure (i.e, individual cage and semi-natural enclosure) experiments, to determine whether rodents can distinguish sound seeds from those infested with insects. We also demonstrate how such responses to insects are influenced by food abundance and other environmental factors. We presented rodents with two kinds of Quercus aliena seeds (sound and insect-infested seeds) in a subtropical forest in Qinling Mountains, central China, from September to November of 2011 to 2013. The result showed that rodents prefer to hoarded and ate sound seeds than infested seeds in the field and semi-natural enclosure, while they prefer to ate infested seeds than sound seeds in the individual cages. In addition, both hoarding and eating decisions were influenced by relative food abundance. Rodents hoarded more sound seeds in years of high food abundance while they ate more both sound and insect-infested seeds when food was less abundant. Compared with field results, rodents reduced scatter hoarding behavior in semi-natural enclosures and ate more insect-infested seeds in smaller individual cages. These results further confirm that rodents distinguish infested seeds form non-infested seeds but demonstrate that this behavior varies with conditions (environment and food abundance). We suggest that such interactions will influence the dispersal and natural regeneration of seeds as well as predation rates on insect larvae. Seed hoarding behaviour of rodents plays an important role in seed dispersal and seedling regeneration of trees, as well as for the evolution of mutualism between trees and rodents in forest ecosystems. There are two opposite views on why rodents adopt a scatter-hoarding strategy: the pilferage avoidance hypothesis predicts that the cache pilferage rate should be very low to ensure benefits of cache owners, while the reciprocal pilferage hypothesis has an opposite prediction. Because it is difficult to identify seed hoarders and pilferers under field conditions by using traditional methods, the full costs incurred and benefits accrued by scatter-hoarding have not been fully evaluated in most seed-rodent systems. Our study aimed to test the two hypotheses at individual level under field conditions. By using infrared camera tracking and seed tagging methods, we investigated the comprehensive benefits and losses of scatter-hoarded Camellia oleifera seeds for three sympatric rodent species ( Apodemus draco , Niviventer confucianus and Leopoldamys edwardsi ) in a subtropical forest of Southwest China 2013-2015. We established the relationships between the rodents and the seeds at the individual level. For each rodent species, we calculated the cache recovery rate of cache owners, as well as conspecific and interspecific pilferage rates. We found all three sympatric rodent species had a cache recovery advantage (recovery rates > 50%) with rates that far exceeded average pilferage rates (<10%) over a 30-day tracking period. The smallest species ( Apodemus draco ) showed the highest rate of scatter-hoarding and the highest recovery advantage compared to the other two larger species. Across species, rates of scatter-hoarding and benefits were positively correlated with each other. Hence species having higher scatter-hoarding preference had higher competitive ability for seeds. Our results suggest that scatter-hoarding benefits the cache owners more in food competition, not the cache pilfers, supporting the pilferage avoidance hypothesis. Seed predation and dispersal by scatter-hoarding rodents play an important role not only on the seedling regeneration of trees, but also on the spatial distribution and structure composition of the whole forest communities. Both seed size and seed density have been found significantly affect the foraging preferences of rodents, which in turn influence the seed fates themselves. Current studies focusing on how seed size and seed density affect foraging behaviour of scatter-hoarding rodents mainly target one of two scales of comparison: the species scale, with comparisons of dispersal and predation of seeds from multiple species; or the individual seed scale, with comparisons among individual seeds from the same species. Even though individual variation in reproductive success within populations is a key component of evolutionary fitness, variation in seed dispersal and predation at the scale of individual trees is poorly understood. Our study asks how variation in seed mass and number among tree individuals affects the behaviour of animal dispersers and in turn the fitness of the trees. We first surveyed intraspecific variation in seed production of two Fagaceae tree species in",2018,6,0,10.1111/AEC.12625,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93e9611ac5575cb2753459899470b09d3ae221f3,Review,Austral ecology (Print)

8b0f76ab3f7971a87c21cbb94946641db30417c5,A review on conjoint application of organic and chemical fertilizers on soil health and productivity of rice-wheat cropping system,"Rice-wheat is the most predominant cropping system in India and covers an area of approximately, 10.5 million ha. However, the productivity of crops under this cropping-system has reached a plateau and in fact is showing a decreasing trend in many areas of India where this cropping system is being practiced for a long time. There are reports of declining factor productivity, i.e. increased rate of fertilizers are needed to maintain the current yield level which is cited as the evidence of unsustainability of the rice-wheat cropping system. The prime causes of low productivity of rice-wheat cropping system in IGP area are insufficient and unbalanced amount of macro and micro nutrient. In cultivation of rice, health and nutrient status of soil declined even in irrigated areas due to application of inadequate and unbalanced quantity of fertilizers. About half of the world’s population is alive today because of increased food production fueled by mineral fertilizers. Other sources of nutrients are organic fertilizers which are good source of plant nutrients such as N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, etc. as well as other organic constituents. Therefore, continuous use of organic fertilizers reduces the nutrient requirement of the soil considerably. But, it is widely recognized that neither use of organic fertilizers alone nor chemical fertilizers can achieve the sustainability of the yield under the modern intensive farming. Contrary to detrimental effects of inorganic fertilizers, organic fertilizers are available indigenously which improve soil health resulting in enhanced crop yield. However, the use of organic manures alone might not meet the plant requirement due to presence of relatively low levels of nutrients. Therefore, in order to make the soil well supplied with all the plant nutrients in the readily available form and to maintain good soil health, it is necessary to use organic manures in conjunction with inorganic fertilizers to obtain optimum yields. To correct the deficiencies in the plant nutrient application methods requires development of precision fertilizer customized technology and hence there is need for application of these nutrients in balance quantity as a customized fertilizer (CF) with special reference to location/region specific for attaining optimum growth, development and enhancing the yield of rice. Keeping the above facts in the view, a review entitled “conjoint application of organic and chemical fertilizers on soil health and productivity of rice-wheat cropping system” has and been complied to present the current scenario of conjoint application of organic nutrients to meet the nutritional requirement of ricewheat system. Key word: Organic amendments, chemical fertilizers, customized fertilizers, soil health and ricewheat system Introduction In the whole world, chemicals based modern agriculture itself imparts a great role in degradation in soil health, whose priority is always only high crop productivity. In the Agricultural sphere, an extensive knowledge on soil degradation is already present. Consequently, the excessive use of synthetic fertilizers, the systematic deforestation, soil erosion due to high tillage and the action of rains or winds, loss of organic matter and several other factors brought about increasing desertification, the loss of millions of tons of fertile",2018,1,0,10.36953/ecj.2018.191224,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b0f76ab3f7971a87c21cbb94946641db30417c5,Review,Environment conservation journal
2bea66872dc842b0b38454eed15a08c1d0b4c619,Determination of tebuconazole and penconazole fungicides in rat and human hair by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.,"RATIONALE
Tebuconazole (TEB) and penconazole (PEN) are widely applied fungicides and environmental contaminants; their toxicological properties include possible effects to the unborn child, therefore, the evaluation of human exposure is relevant to risk assessment. Hair is a non-invasive specimen that incorporates pollutants allowing an extended exposure window to be surveyed. The aim of this work was to develop and validate an assay for the determination of TEB and PEN in human hair.


METHODS
Under optimised conditions, analytes were extracted by soaking hair in acetonitrile, in the presence of deuterated analogues, under heating and agitation. Chemical separation was achieved using a C18 reversed-phase chromatographic column and detection and quantification were performed, after positive electrospray ionization, by triple quadrupole mass spectrometry operating in selected reaction monitoring mode.


RESULTS
The assay validation showed a linear dynamic range up to 5 μg/L or 200 pg/mg hair, inter- and intra-run precisions <6%, and accuracies within 5% of spiked concentrations. Limits of quantification were 0.001 μg/L or 1 pg/mg hair for both TEB and PEN. Matrix effect experiments showed that the isotope dilution approach allowed for the control of bias sources. TEB and PEN were determined in hair of rats exposed to a low dose of TEB and in hair of agricultural workers exposed to TEB and/or PEN during the application season, indicating that both chemicals are incorporated into the hair upon exposure.

d63aed16401591c357b7946797991e9bc3e5b9c8,Robust Long-Term Registration of UAV Images of Crop Fields for Precision Agriculture,"Continuous crop monitoring is an important aspect of precision agriculture and requires the registration of sensor data over longer periods of time. Often, fields are monitored using cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but strong changes in the visual appearance of the growing crops and the field itself poses serious challenges to conventional image registration methods. In this letter, we present a method for registering images of agricultural fields taken by an UAV over the crop season and present a complete pipeline for computing temporally aligned three-dimensional (3-D) point clouds of the field. Our approach exploits the inherent geometry of the crop arrangement in the field, which remains mostly static over time. This allows us to register the images even in the presence of strong visual changes. To this end, we propose a scale invariant, geometric feature descriptor that encodes the local plant arrangement geometry. The experiments suggest that we are able to register images taken over the crop season, including situations where matching with an off-the-shelf visual descriptor fails. We evaluate the accuracy of our matching system with respect to manually labeled ground truth. We furthermore illustrate that the reconstructed 3-D models are qualitatively correct and the registration results allow for monitoring growth parameters at a per plant level.",2018,68,1,10.1109/LRA.2018.2849603,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d63aed16401591c357b7946797991e9bc3e5b9c8,JournalArticle,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters

Efficient and secure data forwarding is essential to maintain seamless communications and to provide fast services. However, IoT devices and sensors usually have low processing capabilities and vulnerabilities. For example, attacks such as the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) can easily hinder sensor networks and IoT devices. In this context, the current approach presents an agent-based simulation solution for exploring strategies for defending from different DDoS attacks. The current work focuses on obtaining low-consuming defense strategies in terms of processing capabilities, so that these can be applied in sensor networks and IoT devices. The experimental results show that the simulator was useful for (a) defining defense and attack strategies, (b) assessing the effectiveness of defense strategies against attack ones, and (c) defining efficient defense strategies with low response times.",2018,6,0,10.1155/2018/7264269,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9050a2c7c1cb3e6650a5c630f973874c4047fa03,JournalArticle,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing

Currently, plant traits, such as emergence rate, biomass, vigor and stand counting are measured manually. This is highly labor intensive and prone to errors. The robot, termed TerraSentia, is designed to automate the measurement of plant traits for efficient phenotyping as an alternative to manual measurements. In this paper, we formulate a Nonlinear Moving Horizon Estimator (NMHE) that identifies key terrain parameters using onboard robot sensors and a learning-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) that ensures high precision path tracking in the presence of unknown wheel-terrain interaction. Moreover, we develop a machine vision algorithm to enable TerraSentia to count corn stands by driving through the fields autonomously. We present results of an extensive field-test study that shows that (i) the robot can track paths precisely with less than 5 cm error so that the robot is less likely to damage plants, and (ii) the machine vision algorithm is robust against interferences from leaves and weeds, and the system has been verified in corn fields at the growth stage of V4, V6, VT, R2, and R6 from five different locations.

WSN consist of a set of sensors that their task is sensing data and send it to a usually one root node. The higher the numbers of sensors, the more impact on the performance of this system will be placed. This is due to many reasons such as; overhead inside the network causing a loss in data, delay in time and the higher power consumption. In this paper, we proposed a new version of RPL that is based on elastic resource consumption. The technique is based on applying the proposed algorithm on precision agriculture especially on smart greenhouse in order to solve some of the degradation performance problems such as; a high-power consumption, a long convergence time and the lost data in WSN.

d2aa0548d1709dd524bdbb66ec3a0b99e2f88f3e,An Efficient Data Warehouse for Crop Yield Prediction,"Nowadays, precision agriculture combined with modern information and communications technologies, is becoming more common in agricultural activities such as automated irrigation systems, precision planting, variable rate applications of nutrients and pesticides, and agricultural decision support systems. In the latter, crop management data analysis, based on machine learning and data mining, focuses mainly on how to efficiently forecast and improve crop yield. In recent years, raw and semi-processed agricultural data are usually collected using sensors, robots, satellites, weather stations, farm equipment, farmers and agribusinesses while the Internet of Things (IoT) should deliver the promise of wirelessly connecting objects and devices in the agricultural ecosystem. Agricultural data typically captures information about farming entities and operations. Every farming entity encapsulates an individual farming concept, such as field, crop, seed, soil, temperature, humidity, pest, and weed. Agricultural datasets are spatial, temporal, complex, heterogeneous, non-standardized, and very large. In particular, agricultural data is considered as Big Data in terms of volume, variety, velocity and veracity. Designing and developing a data warehouse for precision agriculture is a key foundation for establishing a crop intelligence platform, which will enable resource efficient agronomy decision making and recommendations. Some of the requirements for such an agricultural data warehouse are privacy, security, and real-time access among its stakeholders (e.g., farmers, farm equipment manufacturers, agribusinesses, co-operative societies, customers and possibly Government agencies). However, currently there are very few reports in the literature that focus on the design of efficient data warehouses with the view of enabling Agricultural Big Data analysis and data mining.

The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of several processing and data mining techniques to achieve a classification system capable of segmenting cucumbers from the different elements of the scene, such as leaves, stems, the ground, stones, and irrigation pipes. The algorithm includes a support vector machine pixel classifier that provides the initial regions of interest for further processing, a Euclidean distance transform for eliminating less compact blobs that usually correspond to flowers and young leaves, an image category classifier based on a bag-of-visual-words model that increases the detection reliability, and a segmentation procedure based on the watershed transform and the minima imposition technique. Several experimental campaigns were carried out in field conditions to acquire data for training the classifiers and for validating the designed algorithm. Detection performance was evaluated at both the pixel and cucumber levels by comparing the results provided by the proposed algorithm with the ground truth data generated from hand-labeled images. The high hit rate and the low false-positive rate obtained at the pixel level and the high recall and precision at the cucumber level demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the proposed solution and highlight its potential benefits for automatic cucumber-harvesting applications.",2018,38,1,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2851376,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b7c6bd604e608eb403264e3a15bb7a2f35d00c92,JournalArticle,IEEE Access

In practice, varying soil conditions can result in off‐track navigation due to unknown traction coefficients so that it can cause crop damage. To address this problem, this paper presents the development, application, and experimental results of a real‐time receding horizon estimation and control (RHEC) framework applied to a fully autonomous mobile robotic platform to increase its steering accuracy. Recent advances in cheap and fast microprocessors, as well as advances in solution methods for nonlinear optimization problems, have made nonlinear receding horizon control (RHC) and receding horizon estimation (RHE) methods suitable for field robots that require high‐frequency (milliseconds) updates. A real‐time RHEC framework is developed and applied to a fully autonomous mobile robotic platform designed by the authors for in‐field phenotyping applications in sorghum fields. Nonlinear RHE is used to estimate constrained states and parameters, and nonlinear RHC is designed based on an adaptive system model that contains time‐varying parameters. The capabilities of the real‐time RHEC framework are verified experimentally, and the results show an accurate tracking performance on a bumpy and wet soil field. The mean values of the Euclidean error and required computation time of the RHEC framework are equal to 0.0423 m and 0.88 ms, respectively.",2018,43,2,10.1002/rob.21794,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed20c940b5a23d98aff54c1e42ae12bbbedc6656,JournalArticle,J.

Such studies are typical for such applications as space exploration, marine science, point agriculture, geographic information systems and, especially, road transport, where the movement in most cases is carried out on well-known with high accuracy trajectories. Using the functional dependence of the navigation variables in the Greenwich (geocentric) coordinate system, which is widely used in modern navigation, this article provides an analytical solution to the navigation problem of transport objects moving along known trajectories approximated by orthodromic intervals. This solution makes it possible to improve the positioning accuracy of road transport, as well as provides a reduction in the hardware composition of the measuring complex of moving objects and computational costs for the implementation of the navigation algorithm. In order to illustrate the possibility of its practical application in this research, the numerical simulation of the positioning algorithm using noisy odometric and velocity measurements with their subsequent processing in a linear Kalman filter is carried out. The simulation results allow us to conclude that it is possible to provide high accuracy positioning of transport objects moving along known trajectories using the developed approach at computational cost, allowing the implementation of the proposed algorithm in real time due to the small dimension of used linear Kalman filter.

This recent cost reduction and performance improvement means that these systems have become reliable and cheap enough to be viable for mass use by farmers and operators for precision agriculture activities; such as disease identification, yield estimation and plant nitrogen monitoring. A critical stage of this is the planning of the flight path which ensures complete image coverage of the region of interest. If the field is a simple convex shape, then generating an optimal coverage path is hugely simplified by using a back and forth Boustrophedon path. However, most fields have complex polygonal shapes, where planning the coverage path manually is nontrivial, as operators may not have the correct skills and experience. This is why in this paper, we outline an algorithm to improve the performance of survey path generation on complex ROI for mission planning software. The tools implemented in this paper take into account environmental factors and aircraft dynamics. By decomposing these complex survey regions into many smaller arrangements of manageable convex polygon survey regions, Boustrophedon paths can be used to cover them. By using a survey model for calculation of flight time in a wind field. it is used to optimise the decomposition in order to lower flight time. The fastest survey path is used to generate waypoints files to be used with a number of popular mission planning software including: DJI PC Ground Control, Mission Planner, QGroundControl.",2018,18,0,10.23919/CHICC.2018.8482722,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02433964198fd8f8ca2f7894ef7b108a6f4c77c9,"Conference,Review",Cybersecurity and Cyberforensics Conference

The launch of NASA's Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission in 2015 provide new passive global measurements of soil moisture and surface freeze/thaw state at fixed crossing times and spatial resolutions of 36 km. There exists a need for measurements of soil moisture on much smaller spatial scales and arbitrary diurnal times for SMAP validation, precision agriculture, flood runoff prediction, evaporation and transpiration studies of boundary layer heat transport, and tundra thaw studies.

Wet-lab processes to predict the function of a protein are too high-cost to answer to this demand. However, knowing the function of a protein is extremely important in several fields such as medicine and agriculture. Therefore, it is necessary to find computational models able to predict protein function. That is an open research field in Bioinformatics, since the existing models don't perform well enough yet. The Sting DB database gathers relevant informations related to the proteins' physico-chemical characteristics, which have been considered in some researches, most of those limited to a few set of characteristics. In this work, we proposed a methodology utilizing a multi-objective genetic algorithm to find the ideal subset of characteristics to identify the classes of a dataset of enzymes. After the feature selection process, we performed a dataset enhancement by adding new variables, in order to construct a SVM classifier. The proposed methodology achieved 77.3% precision and 72.7% F-Measure averages.",2018,13,1,10.1109/CEC.2018.8477981,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a7bc85f43df4b2ef8dccd1fc493a7ea53e24fc64,JournalArticle,IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation

b42e5166e7093b47980de4b3870eac77e0298ec7,A Hybrid Beacon Scheduling Scheme to Allow the Periodic Reconfiguration of Large-scale Cluster-tree WSNs,"The use of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based technologies is an attractive solution for large-scale sensing applications (wide area deployment), such as environmental monitoring, precision agriculture and industrial automation. IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee standards are the most used communication protocols for WSN technologies, where the clustertree topology is pointed out as a suitable topology to support the implementation of large-scale WSNs. These networks are usually scheduled to prioritise convergecast (upstream) traffic generated from sensor nodes toward the sink node. However, this scheduling pattern results in higher delays for control messages (downstream traffic). Within this context, this paper proposes a Hybrid Beacon Scheduling (Fast-HyBeS) scheme to enable the periodic reconfiguration of cluster-tree WSNs. The underlying idea is to periodically schedule a downstream opportunity window, to allow a faster dissemination of control messages. This opportunity window follows a top-down scheduling approach that prioritises the downstream traffic. Simulation results show that the use of Fast-HyBeS can significantly decrease the end-to-end communication delay for control messages, when compared to the use of static convergecast scheduling schemes. Moreover, the simulation results also highlight that the Fast-HyBeS has a negligible impact upon end-to-end communication delays of the monitoring traffic.",2018,2,0,10.1109/INDIN.2018.8472110,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b42e5166e7093b47980de4b3870eac77e0298ec7,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference on Industrial Informatics

Reconstruction of polarimetric features from collection of SAR data is computationally expensive, and more important, the inter-features correlations cause decreased performance in regression based biophysical parameter estimation. With the scope of operational crop monitoring, this study provides key variables to drive Leaf Area Index (LAI) from polarimetric data based on global sensitivity analysis (GSA) addressing the ranking of the most influential features. We applied variance-based GSA for temporal fully-polarimetric RadarSAt-2 images acquired through the cultivation period of two crops; canola and barley.

fc9fc5903a8f4d73f426fead19b70caa32c88fd4,Computational Deep Intelligence Vision Sensing for Nutrient Content Estimation in Agricultural Automation,"This paper presents a novel computational intelligence vision sensing approach to estimate nutrient content in wheat leaves by analyzing color features of the leaves images captured on field with various lighting conditions. We propose the development of deep sparse extreme learning machines (DSELM) fusion and genetic algorithm (GA) to normalize plant images as well as to reduce color variability due to a variation of sunlight intensities. We also apply the DSELM in image segmentation to differentiate wheat leaves from a complex background. In this paper, four moments of color distribution of the leaves images (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) are extracted and utilized as predictors in the nutrient estimation. We combine a number of DSELMs with committee machine and optimize them using the GA to estimate nitrogen content in wheat leaves. The results have shown the superiority of the proposed method in the term of quality and processing speed in all steps, i.e., color normalization, image segmentation, and nutrient prediction, as compared with other existing methods. Note to Practitioners—In order to support precision farming technology and agricultural automation, it is very essential to estimate the nutrient content in plants to prevent over fertilizing that will harm environment. Furthermore, the existing method to determine nutrient content in leaves is destructive as well as time consuming and requires special expertise to operate expensive devices. A number of methods have been developed to estimate nutrient content in leaves nondestructively based on the color features of the leaves. Most of these methods, however, are conducted in a controlled environment with artificial lighting. Such methods are not practical and need various equipment. We propose a low-cost, simple, and accurate technique to estimate nitrogen content in wheat leaves by analyzing RGB color of the leaves images. In this paper, we found that the developed DSELMs fusion has enabled better performance in normalizing images and is faster than other neural network types, i.e., backpropagation-based multilayer perceptron and original extreme learning machine. In image segmentation step, the established DSELM shows good performance to recognize and distinguish wheat leaves from other undesired background images. Furthermore, the developed weighted DSELMs have demonstrated enhanced ability in estimating nutrient content.",2018,50,4,10.1109/TASE.2017.2770170,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc9fc5903a8f4d73f426fead19b70caa32c88fd4,JournalArticle,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering

Remote sensing using drones and aircrafts offers a feasible tool to carry out this task. Our objective was to develop and assess a methodology for crop biomass and nitrogen estimation, integrating spectral and 3D features that can be extracted using airborne miniaturized multispectral, hyperspectral and colour (RGB) cameras. We used the Random Forest (RF) as the estimator, and in addition Simple Linear Regression (SLR) was used to validate the consistency of the RF results. The method was assessed with empirical datasets captured of a barley field and a grass silage trial site using a hyperspectral camera based on the Fabry-Pérot interferometer (FPI) and a regular RGB camera onboard a drone and an aircraft. Agricultural reference measurements included fresh yield (FY), dry matter yield (DMY) and amount of nitrogen. In DMY estimation of barley, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and the normalized Root Mean Square Error (RMSE%) were at best 0.95% and 33.2%, respectively; and in the grass DMY estimation, the best results were 0.79% and 1.9%, respectively. In the nitrogen amount estimations of barley, the PCC and RMSE% were at best 0.97% and 21.6%, respectively. In the biomass estimation, the best results were obtained when integrating hyperspectral and 3D features, but the integration of RGB images and 3D features also provided results that were almost as good.

ca969f3a53ec9a7bfee4d8198e7b1a36e474c63a,Integration of NIR on a multi-sensor platform to improve soil resource assessments,"Soil is an intriguing and complex entity in terms of physics, chemistry and biology. It has solid, liquid and gas elements, mineral and organic parts and inert and living constituents. All these different components interact on multiple levels between themselves and with external factors such as weather and human activities. These interactions contribute ultimately to the large spatial and temporal variabilities in soil properties, which can be observed at different scales – from global to regional to even the individual field. The soil science community has made incredible progress over the last decades, but we are still far from fully understanding the dynamic complexity that governs soil attributes and processes. Harnessing soil variabilities, across space and time, is a critical step to the sustainable management of that resource. The precision agriculture paradigm provides an illustration of the value of such information: if sitespecific nutrient zones can be delineated in some way, then farmers have an evidence base to fine-tune their inputs (nutrients, water), and adapt these to the very local requirements of the crop. If erosion-prone areas can be identified, appropriate management and remediation procedures can be suggested. If the soils of a farm, or even of a field, can be split into contiguous zones according to their ability to hold onto water, sitespecific irrigation plans can be developed to optimise water use and minimise detrimental effects such as runoff or leaching. To do this, extensive soil sampling, at high temporal and spatial resolution, is required. The reference chemistry laboratory analyses used traditionally in soil science produce high-accuracy results but are not an appropriate solution due the detrimental costs in time and money. To overcome this issue, the soil science community started, years ago, to consider a trade-off of some degree of accuracy if that translates into more samples recorded.",2018,2,0,10.1177/0960336018782035,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca969f3a53ec9a7bfee4d8198e7b1a36e474c63a,JournalArticle,NIR news

Camellia oleifera flowers are rich in flavonoids, but there has been little attention on their application. A simple and reliable method for determining the content of flavonoids in C. oleifera flowers would be very helpful for the utilisation of agriculture resources.


OBJECTIVE
To develop an efficient analytical method for the determination of flavonoids in C. oleifera flowers by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) detection.


METHODOLOGY
Preparing an environmentally-friendly and effective solvent - deep eutectic solvents (DESs) - for compound extraction. Then investigating the influential factors of ultrasound-assisted extraction with DESs by the Box-Behnken design combined with response surface methodology.


RESULTS
DES-5 synthesised with choline chloride and lactic acid (1:2) acquired excellent extractability for four flavonoids (quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside, kaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside and their aglycones) with different polarity. The proposed method, which could simultaneously determine four flavonoids with HPLC-UV detection for the first time, displays satisfactory recovery yields and high precision with inter-day relative standard deviation lower than 5.80%.


CONCLUSION

e1d4781b6b08603d2029a75fe447f1e4c09d1b59,Agricultural Monitoring System: A Study on Agricultural Monitoring System with Zigbee Mesh Implementation,": Today energy resources are becoming scarcer and therefore more valuable. In conjunction with the population growth over last century, the need for finding new, more efficient, and sustainable methods of agricultural cultivation and food production has become more critical. To facilitate this process, we are designing, building, and evaluating a system for precision agriculture which provides farmers with useful data about the soil, the water supply, and the general condition of their fields in a user friendly, easily accessible manner. Our system aims to make cultivation and irrigation more efficient as the farmer is able to make better informed decisions and thus save time and resources. The diversity of location and climatic effects upon agricultural cultivation, along with other environmental parameters over time makes the farmer’s decision-making process more complicated and requires additional empirical knowledge. Applying wireless sensor networks for monitoring environmental parameters and combining this information with a user-customized web service may enable farmers to exploit their knowledge in an efficient way in order to extract the best results from their agricultural cultivation. The system can scale based on each farmer’s demands and the resulting ensemble of collected information may represent a valuable resource for future use, in addition to its use for real-time decision making. The design of the precision agriculture system contains a prototype solution regarding the sensor platform and a customizable service that can be utilized in different ways and by several entities. The main objective of the thesis is to develop a smart wireless sensor network (WSN) for an agricultural environment. Monitoring agricultural environment for various factors such as temperature, gas and humidity along with other factors can be of significance. A traditional approach to measure these factors in an agricultural environment meant individuals manually taking measurements and checking them at various times. This thesis investigates a remote monitoring system using Zigbee which is comprised with X-CTU software with the help of Arduino circuit board. These nodes send data wirelessly to a central server, which collects the data, stores it and will allow it to be analyzed then displayed as needed and can also be sent to the client mobile.",2018,0,0,10.70729/ijser183,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e1d4781b6b08603d2029a75fe447f1e4c09d1b59,JournalArticle,International journal of scientific engineering and research
27a918a368e971a15b545abf63353e269a8ce8a2,WeedMap: A large-scale semantic weed mapping framework using aerial multispectral imaging and deep neural network for precision farming,"The ability to automatically monitor agricultural fields is an important capability in precision farming, enabling steps towards more sustainable agriculture. Precise, high-resolution monitoring is a key prerequisite for targeted intervention and the selective application of agro-chemicals. The main goal of this paper is developing a novel crop/weed segmentation and mapping framework that processes multispectral images obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a deep neural network (DNN). Most studies on crop/weed semantic segmentation only consider single images for processing and classification. Images taken by UAVs often cover only a few hundred square meters with either color only or color and near-infrared (NIR) channels. Although a map can be generated by processing single segmented images incrementally, this requires additional complex information fusion techniques which struggle to handle high fidelity maps due to their computational costs and problems in ensuring global consistency. Moreover, computing a single large and accurate vegetation map (e.g., crop/weed) using a DNN is non-trivial due to difficulties arising from: (1) limited ground sample distances (GSDs) in high-altitude datasets, (2) sacrificed resolution resulting from downsampling high-fidelity images, and (3) multispectral image alignment. To address these issues, we adopt a stand sliding window approach that operates on only small portions of multispectral orthomosaic maps (tiles), which are channel-wise aligned and calibrated radiometrically across the entire map. We define the tile size to be the same as that of the DNN input to avoid resolution loss. Compared to our baseline model (i.e., SegNet with 3 channel RGB (red, green, and blue) inputs) yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of [background=0.607, crop=0.681, weed=0.576], our proposed model with 9 input channels achieves [0.839, 0.863, 0.782]. Additionally, we provide an extensive analysis of 20 trained models, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in order to evaluate the effects of varying input channels and tunable network hyperparameters. Furthermore, we release a large sugar beet/weed aerial dataset with expertly guided annotations for further research in the fields of remote sensing, precision agriculture, and agricultural robotics.",2018,243,18,10.3390/RS10091423,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27a918a368e971a15b545abf63353e269a8ce8a2,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

Essential Oil and γ-Radiation on Growth Rate and Mycotoxins Content of Fusarium graminearum in Maize: Response Surface Methodology,"Nowadays, contamination of agricultural commodities with fungi and their mycotoxins is one of the most annoying with regard to food safety and pose serious health risk. Therefore, there is a requisite to propose suitable mitigation strategies to reduce the contamination of fungi and mycotoxins in agricultural commodities. In the present study, combinational inhibitory effect of Hedychium spicatum L. essential oil (HSEO) and radiation was established on growth rate, production of deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA) by Fusarium graminearum in maize grains. The HSEO was obtained from rhizomes by hydrodistillation technique and chemical composition was revealed by GC-MS analysis. A total of 48 compounds were identified and major compounds were 1,8-cineole (23.15%), linalool (12.82%), and β-pinene (10.06%). The discrete treatments of HSEO and radiation were effective in reducing the fungal growth rate and mycotoxins content, and the complete reduction was noticed at 3.15 mg/g of HSEO and 6 kGy of radiation. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to evaluate the combinational inhibitory effect of HSEO and radiation treatments on fungal growth rate and mycotoxins content. A total of 13 experiments were designed with distinct doses of HSEO and radiation by central composite design (CCD) of Stat-Ease Design-Expert software. In combinational approach, complete reductions of fungal growth, DON, and ZEA content were noticed at 1.89 mg/g of HSEO and 4.12 kGy of radiation treatments. The optimized design concluded that combinational treatments of HSEO and radiation were much more effective in reducing the fungal growth and mycotoxins content compared to their discrete treatments (p < 0.05). Responses of the design were assessed by second-order polynomial regression analysis and found that quadratic model was well fitted. The optimized design has larger F-value and adequate precision, smaller p-value, decent regression coefficients (R2) and found statistically significant (p < 0.05). In addition, correlation matrix, normal plot residuals, Box-Cox, and actual vs. predicted plots were endorsed that optimized design was accurate and appropriate. The proposed combinational decontamination technique could be highly applicable in agriculture and food industry to safeguard the food and feed products from fungi and mycotoxins.",2018,21,2,10.3389/fmicb.2018.01511,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/377a2955db5598fdc6a8201487e4d403aa1ce6b6,JournalArticle,Frontiers in Microbiology

The goal is to compute a shortest path that visits a given set of cones. The apex of each cone is restricted to lie on the ground plane. The common angle α of the cones represent the field of view of the onboard camera. The cone heights, which can be varying, correspond with the desired observation quality (e.g. resolution). This problem is a novel variant of the traveling salesman problem with neighborhoods (TSPN). We name it Cone-TSPN. Our main contribution is a polynomial time approximation algorithm for Cone-TPSN. We analyze its theoretical performance and show that it returns a solution whose length is at most O ( 1 + log ( h max / h min ) ) times the length of the optimal solution where h max and h min are the heights of the tallest and shortest input cones, respectively.We demonstrate the use of our algorithm in a representative precision agriculture application. We further study its performance in simulation using randomly generated cone sets.

Remote sensing technology has utility in monitoring wheat coverage in a timely and nondestructive manner over a given spatial scale for precision agriculture. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are flexible and can easily be manipulated. They can acquire images with high spatial and temporal resolutions at low cost when equipped with sensors. However, the application of UAVs is still in its initial phases. The objective of this study is to estimate wheat coverage using multispectral images obtained with a low-cost UAV sensor named RedEdge-M and a four-rotor UAV. To meet this goal, a nitrogen fertilization experiment on wheat conducted at the Xiaotangshan National Precision Agriculture Experimental Base in Changping district, Beijing, was used. Multispectral images of wheat in Feekes growth stage 4 were obtained. Additionally, wheat coverage at representative points in each plot were measured by traditional photographic methods. Based on the data described above, spectral data for the sampling points were first extracted from the obtained RedEdge images. Second, the sampling data were divided into two parts. One part contained 24 randomly selected sampling points that were used to design the wheat coverage estimation model, whereas the other part contained the remaining 8 sampling points that were used to test the model. During this process, commonly used spectral indices that are suitable for coverage prediction were selected and used to produce a coverage estimation model. The results showed that multispectral images obtained using RedEdge-M have great potential for use in estimating wheat coverage. All of the selected spectral indices are closely related to wheat coverage. Of these indices, the Triangular Vegetation Index (TVI) and Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDRE) displayed the best performance. During calibration, the R2 values obtained using the TVI and the NDRE were 0.96 and 0.97, respectively; the corresponding RMSE values were 1.56% and 1.50, and the RMSE% values were 8.91 and 8.55. During model validation, the R2 values were 0.90 and 0.90, the RMSE values were 3.11% and 3.31%, and the RMSE% values were 16.96 and 18.05, respectively.",2018,5,0,10.1109/AGRO-GEOINFORMATICS.2018.8476059,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d8855ad4c89c0728e026042b428155862f62055,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics

192771797e8da82d820b3d3badc643682a31aa8b,Digital Mapping of Soil Available Phosphorus Supported by AI Technology for Precision Agriculture,"Precision agriculture has been proposed to improve the sustainability of agriculture and solve the environmental pollution of soil. In precision agriculture process, the management of water and fertilizer is carried out on agricultural operation units. Therefore, acquisition of accurate soil nutrient distribution information is a key step for precision agriculture application and digital soil mapping is an effective technology. Significant progress has been made in digital soil mapping over the past 20 years. However, the current digital soil mapping framework was implemented based on grids, which was not consistent with the operation units of precision agriculture. This paper proposed a geo-parcel based digital soil mapping framework on the support of artificial intelligence technology for precision agriculture application. Two key technologies were studied for the implementation of this framework. Geo-parcels automatic extraction was the basis of this method, and a modified VGG 16 network was used for geo-parcels' accurate boundary extraction from high resolution images. Different machine learning methods were attempted to construct the relationship between soil available phosphorus and environment on geo-parcels. We chose an agricultural region in Zhongning County, Ningxia Province as the study area, and the new digital soil mapping framework was applied for soil available phosphorus mapping. This research showed that geo-parcel based digital mapping method could reduce the number of prediction units more than 50% for fine soil mapping, and effectively improve the prediction and application efficiency. This study was an attempt to realize soil mapping based on agricultural operation units for precision agriculture application. The high resolution remote sensing images provide basic data for the realization of this idea and the development of AI technology provides technical support for it. In the future, we will carry out experiments in larger areas to further optimize this method and key technologies for the applications in more complex environments.",2018,20,0,10.1109/AGRO-GEOINFORMATICS.2018.8476007,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/192771797e8da82d820b3d3badc643682a31aa8b,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics
38149f5ed0e17383ae6468597c140464933edf88,IoT Based Low-cost Weather Station and Monitoring System for Precision Agriculture in India,"In recent times it is seen that the climatic and weather conditions not only in India but also in other countries have become uncertain and unpredictable, which may have devastating effects on the agriculture production. India being an agricultural country, most of the farmers largely rely on monsoons and agricultural production is weather dependent. The environmental factors like temperature, humidity, moisture, precipitation and many other parameters keep on changing rapidly and unpredictably. This unpredictable nature, variability of climatic or weather conditions makes the life of farmers quite miserable as they are unable to take proper decisions at the right time. Thus, it is the need of the hour to have a real-time, local weather station which would keep the farmers informed well in advance about the prevailing weather conditions so that they can take appropriate decisions at the right time and save their crops from loss. Precision Agriculture (PA) is an art of using the latest available technologies in the agriculture domain so as to make traditional agriculture more profitable and sustainable while reducing the wastage of resources. The penetration of internet into India is very deep and very fast, especially due to the Jio mania by Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited last year, high speed internet is now possible even in rural areas. This paper proposes a IoT based real-time local weather station for PA, that would provide farmers a means of automizing their agricultural practices (irrigation, fertilization, harvesting) at the right time. The proposed system would also aid the farmers to carry out the agricultural tasks on real-time bases, which in turn helps them to use the agricultural resources in efficient way and at the time when needed by the crops. The proposed weather system is a small step towards the development of PA system considering the Indian scenarios.",2018,64,1,10.1109/I-SMAC.2018.8653749,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/38149f5ed0e17383ae6468597c140464933edf88,Conference,"2018 2nd International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC)I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC), 2018 2nd International Conference on"
3cab253479af8c7e051b2878da6bb526df67ea82,Assessment of Monitoring Regional Cropping System with Temporal Extraction Model Based on GF-1/WFV Imagery,"Obtaining the information on the cropping system in a region accurately and timely is important for optimizing the regional agricultural resource allocation and crop layout. However, there are still technical bottlenecks such as poor spatial resolution, low precision and the lack of imagery in the application of remote sensing research in the spatial and temporal distribution of the cropping system. In this study, a more accurate remote sensing monitoring method for the regional cropping system was proposed. The imagery with wide field of view (WFV) of multi-temporal GF-1 satellite was used to construct a temporal extraction model of the cropping system, which was based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Using the method proposed in this paper, remote sensing monitoring of the main farming system in Suqian City, Jiangsu Province was carried out, which could provide reference for the extraction of the crop system in southern cloud and rain regions. The results showed that the whole crop development period of the main planting system (rice-winter wheat and winter wheat-summer maize) in the study area was covered by selecting the high time density GF-1 / WFV with 16 m resolution remote sensing imagery acquired from 2016 to 2017 as the data sources, and the complementarity of the multi-temporal imagery avoided the imagery loss caused by the cloudy climate in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. By building a mask and marking the “polluted” areas of the cloud, the interference of cloud imagery on crop information extraction was reduced effectively. In addition, the decision condition was optimized several times by the human-computer interaction, and the key parameter was determined to ensure the accuracy of the temporal extraction model. According to the result of monitoring the major cropping system in Suqian City, the overall classification accuracy was 93.56%, Kappa coefficient was 0.85 and the relative margin of error for individual crops was 7.53%, which met the accuracy requirements for application of agricultural achievements. These results showed that, in comparison with previous remote sensing methods, the method proposed in this study can monitor the regional main crop planting system accurately and can be used to monitor the cropping system based on the high-resolution imagery in multiple ripening areas. In this way, this approach will provide theoretical basis and technical support for the development of the precision agriculture, the optimization of regional cropping patterns and the efficient utilization of agricultural resources.",2018,0,0,10.1109/AGRO-GEOINFORMATICS.2018.8476108,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3cab253479af8c7e051b2878da6bb526df67ea82,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics

In this study, we firstly reviewed the technical systems and bascial benefits of PA, and then evaluated the effects of PA technology on winter wheat yield, residual soil nitrogen and economic benefit. Three treatments, single precision seeding technology (PS), integrated precision seeding with laser land leveling technologies (PLS) and conventional land leveling and seeding technologies (CLS) were established in winter wheat cropland of central China. The result showed that PLS rather than PS significantly increased wheat yield and straw biomass after one season. PS treatment significantly reduced residual soil NO3−-N and NH4+-N, whereas PLS treatment only significantly decreased residual soil NH4+ - N. Adoption of PA technology increased net return by 4.95%, 37.60% and 30.16% for PS, sudsidy and non-subsidy of PLS treatments, respctively.

However, few studies have compared the technologies of different communication standards in terms of topology and energy efficiency. This paper presents the design and implementation of the hardware and software of three WSNs with different technologies and topologies of wireless communication for tomato greenhouses in the Andean region of Ecuador, as well as the comparative study of the performance of each of them. Two companion papers describe the study of the dynamics of the energy consumption and of the monitored variables. Three WSNs were deployed, two of them with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard with star and mesh topologies (ZigBee and DigiMesh, respectively), and a third with the IEEE 802.11 standard with access point topology (WiFi). The measured variables were selected after investigation of the climatic conditions required for efficient tomato growth. The measurements for each variable could be displayed in real time using either a laboratory virtual instrument engineering workbench (LabVIEWTM) interface or an Android mobile application. The comparative study of the three networks made evident that the configuration of the DigiMesh network is the most complex for adding new nodes, due to its mesh topology. However, DigiMesh maintains the bit rate and prevents data loss by the location of the nodes as a function of crop height. It has been also shown that the WiFi network has better stability with larger precision in its measurements.",2018,26,1,10.3390/s18082555,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4715a7daaf37aef053371401a48f7ca87ef1bb18,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

To study the potential for machine learning to learn local soil moisture conditions directly from such images, we developed a very fast, linear discrete-time simulation of plant growth based on the Richards equation. We use the simulator to generate large datasets of synthetic aerial images of a vineyard with known moisture conditions and then compare seven methods for inferring moisture conditions from images, in which the “uncorrelated plant” methods look at individual plants and the “correlated field” methods look at the entire vineyard: 1) constant prediction baseline, 2) linear Support Vector Machines (SVM), 3) Random Forests Uncorrelated Plant (RFUP), 4) Random Forests Correlated Field (RFCF), 5) two-layer Neural Networks (NN), 6) Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Uncorrelated Plant (CNNUP), and 7) Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Correlated Field (CNNCF). Experiments on held-out test images show that a globally-connected CNN performs best with normalized mean absolute error of 3.4%. Sensitivity experiments suggest that learned global CNNs are robust to injected noise in both the simulator and generated images as well as in the size of the training sets. In simulation, we compare the agricultural standard of flood irrigation to a proportional precision irrigation controller using the output of the global CNN and find that the latter can reduce water consumption by up to 52% and is also robust to errors in irrigation level, location, and timing.

However, the existing methods were difficult to provide accurate decision-making support information, which made the effectiveness of this policy gradually reduced. In this paper, we proposed a method to calculate the agricultural decision information accurately by using multi-source remote sensing images. Firstly, we accurately extracted the boundary of cultivated land (geo-parcel) from high spatial resolution remote sensing image. Secondly, we constructed a NDVI time series from multi-source medium-resolution remote sensing images, established the growth curve of crop on each geo-parcel, and identify the crop type planted on each geo-parcel. Thirdly, we established the exact calculation model to realize the decision information calculation based on the geo-parcel. On the basis of the method proposed in this paper, we selected Li County, Hunan Province as the study area to carry out the application of grain planting subsidies.

6c353d6add8a8f1f646bad1c22d48829ab8330cf,Machine-Vision Based Location Detection Solutions for Autonomous Horticulture Rover During Early Growth Season,"In this paper, we present a complete set of solutions to detect the location of the autonomous horticulture rover used for precision agriculture purposes during the early growth stage of the crops. The horticulture rover autonomously traverses the furrow by aligning itself with the centerline using the dynamic inversion navigation algorithm. The navigation algorithm takes the cross-track error and heading error of the rover deviating from the centerline as the location input, and outputs the desired left and right track speeds to the control system to correct the rover course. The rover has been using the real time kinematic (RTK) -based global position system (GPS) as the sensor to detect the location of the rover, but satellite signals can suffer from sporadic loss, and the geographical characteristics of the environment need to be accurately mapped beforehand. These limits of RTK GPS drastically increase the work load of the operators and decrease the location detection accuracy of the rover. The proposed easy-to-implement machine-vision based location detection solution set accepts the raw pictures taken by the camera mounted on the rover as input and calculate the cross-track and heading errors of the rover as outputs. It neither requires the usage of GPS, nor acquisition of environmental geographical information beforehand. Our test results indicate that the proposed machine-vision based solution set is able to outperform the RTK GPS by providing the cross-track location and heading information of the rover with an error less than 20% of that achieved by a RTK GPS, when the rover is within the furrow during the early growth stage.",2018,3,0,10.1109/IISR.2018.8535837,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c353d6add8a8f1f646bad1c22d48829ab8330cf,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Symposium on Robotics

Machine vision system necessary for crop row and weed detection. This paper proposes an automatic furrow detection system based on identifying crop rows in maize fields in the presence of weeds. The image quality is affected by different lighting conditions and gaps between the crop furrows due to lack of germination. The proposed image processing method consists of four different processes. First, image segmentation based on HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) decision tree. The HSV color space used to discriminate crops, weeds, sky, and soil. The region of interest (ROI) is defined by filtering each of the HSV channels between the maximum and minimum threshold values. Then, the noises in the images are eliminated by selecting pixel values. Further, mathematical morphological processes, that is, erosion to remove smaller objects followed by dilation to enlarge the boundaries of regions of foreground pixels are applied. To detect the position of crop rows, ROI was defined by creating a binary mask. The Hough Transform and blob analysis were applied to detect crop furrows. The experimental results show that the method is effective.",2018,7,0,10.1109/MWSCAS.2018.8623906,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6e4b96a8d19dde057484836f5d69ae2a4ed3f0a2,JournalArticle,Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems

Many recent research works address the use of optimization techniques and technological resources on precision agriculture, especially in large demand crops, including climatic variables monitoring using wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, few studies have focused on analyzing the dynamics of the environmental measurement properties in greenhouses. In the two companion papers, we describe the design and implementation of three WSNs with different technologies and topologies further scrutinizing their comparative performance, and a detailed analysis of their energy consumption dynamics is also presented, both considering tomato greenhouses in the Andean region of Ecuador. The three WSNs use ZigBee with star topology, ZigBee with mesh topology (referred to here as DigiMesh), and WiFi with access point topology. The present study provides a systematic and detailed analysis of the environmental measurement dynamics from multiparametric monitoring in Ecuadorian tomato greenhouses. A set of monitored variables (including CO2, air temperature, and wind direction, among others) are first analyzed in terms of their intrinsic variability and their short-term (circadian) rhythmometric behavior. Then, their cross-information is scrutinized in terms of scatter representations and mutual information analysis. Based on Bland–Altman diagrams, good quality rhythmometric models were obtained at high-rate sampling signals during four days when using moderate regularization and preprocessing filtering with 100-coefficient order. Accordingly, and especially for the adjustment of fast transition variables, it is appropriate to use high sampling rates and then to filter the signal to discriminate against false peaks and noise. In addition, for variables with similar behavior, a longer period of data acquisition is required for the adequate processing, which makes more precise the long-term modeling of the environmental signals.",2018,16,1,10.3390/s18082557,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8abea65eb9ed70cd3580ef326b97dd610f6adc6e,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

It involves the transfer of pot seedlings from seedlings try into growing media in a greenhouse or an open agricultural field for further growth. This activity is a labor intensive, time consuming and requires high accuracy and precision, thus there is a need for mechanized operation to meet the challenges. In the current state, the automated and robotic seedlings transplanters have low production capability and most of them are met to work in greenhouse.

The proposed robot is composed of two identical 2DOF translational parallel robots, 1DOF multi-gripper end-effector, conveyors and drives. During conceptual design phase, the speed, work efficiency and transplanting agronomical practices are taken into consideration. Some constraints are also taken into consideration during the dimensional synthesis of this parallel robot to obtain the robot dimensions.

ABSTRACTIntroduction: Among the areas devoted to agriculture in Brazil, the area stands out with soybean cultivation, which reached approximately 34 thousand hectares in the 2016/17 harvest. Initially, soybean cultivation was more pronounced in the southern region of the country, it spread to the center-west region that became the national granary of large crops, and more recently broke agricultural frontiers reaching a significant area under cultivation in the legal Amazon. Objectives: The objective of this work was to evaluate the germination potential and initial vigor of two soybean cultivars (Glycine max) obtained from the germination test according to the SAR (Seed Analysis Rule) standards. Materials and Methods: For this, an experiment was conducted at the FIMCA Bromatology Laboratory,with two soybean cultivars, BRS7680RR and BRS7780IPRO, available from EMBRAPA-RO. The seeds were seeded in trays with the following substrates: soil + medium washed sand (2: 1) and paper rolls (control). Subsequently, the tray was conditioned under nurseryconditions, and the control was maintained under laboratory conditions (temperature of 25 ± 0.5 ºC). The substrate and the roll of paper were moistened, aiming to maintain humidity between 85-90%, where they remained for seven days; being the first count performed onthe 4th day and the last on the 7th day after sowing. The experimental design was completely randomized, in a 2 x 2 factorial scheme, with four replications. Each replicate was composed of 50 seeds, totaling 200 seeds per treatment. The height of the seedlings and root length were recorded after the seventh day after sowing (DAS), with the aid of a millimeter ruler. To obtain the total fresh and dry mass, 10 seedlings were collected and weighed on a precision scale, and then packed in a paper bag and dried in a drying oven with forced air circulation for 72 hours at 60 ° C. After drying, the samples were again weighed for determination of the total dry mass (MST). . Results: Significant differences were found for the analyzed characteristic, according to the F test, at 1% probability. The cultivar BRS7680RR expressed higher germinative vigor (98%) and higher total dry biomass in relation to cultivar BRS7780 IPRO.

It increases soil porosity and water holding capacity. Monitoring the spatial distribution of SOM timely and accurately is very important for fertilization management in precision agriculture. Imaging hyperspectrometer carried on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been developed rapidly in recent years. The study aimed to test the practicability of monitoring SOM by imaging hyperspectrometer in a small scale. The 132 soil samples in the study were collected from three regions. The quantitative relationships between SOM and spectral reflectivity with different pixel sizes were analyzed by the transformation method of principal component analysis (PCA). After screening sensitive bands and spectral parameters, partial least square method (PLS) was used to develop the inversion models of SOM to evaluate the optimal scale of imaging hyperspectrometer application in monitoring SOM. Two-third of SOM samples were used to develop the PCA-PLS models. Results showed that the first two principal components of hyperspectral image could reach 99.80% relative information, which were chosen as spectral parameters of SOM. The correlations between SOM and PCA1 or PCA2 were analyzed with five resampling sizes, all of which reached above 0.4. One-third of SOM samples were used to evaluate the accuracy of the inversion with determination coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Results showed that all PCA-PLS models of predicting SOM could get good accuracy, all R2 above 0.3. With the resampling size increasing, the accuracies of PCA-PLS models increased first and then decreased. The model with 3*3 resampling size reached highest accuracy, of which the R2 was 0.3411, while RMSE was 3.071 g/kg. It indicated that the PCA method could make the best of hyperspectrum information to monitor SOM effectively.",2018,1,0,10.1109/AGRO-GEOINFORMATICS.2018.8476034,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c555707410939142cdd86e9152bb289402b893ec,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics

With the population continuously growing, the area of cropland in the middle reach of Heihe River basin has soared and now makes up about 95% of the total arable land. The water used in the region accounts for 68% of the total water resources consumed in the entire basin, of which the main expenditure is evapotranspiration of farmland. The large amount of agricultural water consumption has led to a series of ecological and social conflicts, which highlight the great importance in understanding the evolution of oasis ecosystem and rational allocation of regional water resources. Quantifying regional evapotranspiration and predicting evapotranspiration fluctuation reasonably in a certain period may offer a new method to resolve the conflicts. We select a representative oasis transect as the study area, using Landsat data and meteorological data during the middle crop growth stage in the summer from 2001 to 2016 as the main source data. A one-source model named Mapping evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) is selected to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of the ET in the study area. Based on derived ET with METRIC, the development trend of ET in 2022 is predicted by a simulation method with CA_Markov model. The experimental results indicate the following results. 1) The regional distribution change of ET, processed by density slice, is closely related to the evolution of land types in the study area, and its development trend can reflect the change pattern of different land types. Statistical results show that the area of desert region notably decreases while the area of oasis region rises, which is consistent with the visual results. 2) From 2001 to 2007, the area of river region increased, suggesting that the past water-managing measures worked. However, between 2007 and 2016, the area of river region gradually shrank with the continuous increase of agricultural and urban water use. It is predicted that in 2022, the area of river region will decline further, the burden of water resources will be aggravated. 3) The prediction results obtained by combining METRIC model and CA_Markov model can get a preferable accuracy (kappa>0.4) in some conditions, but it is worth noting that they are affected by many factors, e.g., time span and parameter setting. 4) The method can achieve credible precision in short-term prediction. However, with the extension of the prediction span, the pixels with similar state characteristics will gradually aggregate and generate spots, which can result in some deviation.",2018,0,0,10.1109/AGRO-GEOINFORMATICS.2018.8475997,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d13e6c92641496eadeb185aebf34e0c779fbabef,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics

It requires buried underground sensors to provide useful content information to the end-user for crop management. In our earlier studies, we developed an impedance measurement-based in-situ wireless soil moisture and salinity sensor, an electrophoretic sensor for measuring soil ions/nutrients, and nano-patterned plasmonic-resonance, as well as guided-mode resonance-based optical sensors for the plant, released volatile organic compounds. Here we present a physics-based approach to infer the moisture and ionic concentration in the soil from in-situ, multi-frequency measurements of the impedance of a metamaterial-inspired sensing element buried underground. Such model holds the advantage over empirical models by obviating the need to redo the calibration for different soil types. Our method involves performing an inversion analysis on the Bruggeman’s dielectric mixing model. Under the quasi-static assumption, the approach predicts volumetric moisture content and ion concentration with 90% accuracy in terms of the molar fraction of total volume for silver nitrate concentrations of 0 to 100 mM. We observed that soil conductivity is near-linear to the inferred ionic concentration for a given saline water fraction in the soil. The model has been validated by making multi-frequency impedance measurements of a soil mixture at different concentrations comprising of various constituents of soil, air, water, and ions.",2018,19,1,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2862634,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c58fe08a1833f0455253231c42b1ee40eec03c5f,JournalArticle,IEEE Access

The update of the Greek LPIS is implemented through Remote Sensing and multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) techniques within a GIS application environment using aerial photographs and/or high precision satellite images. The basic procedure for the implementation of the LPIS comprises of: a) the identification and delineation of the homogeneous land cover areas characterized as ilots, b) the classification of these ilots based on their land use and c) the exclusion of the non-agricultural areas inside the agricultural ilots, characterized as subilots. Ilots can be either agricultural or non-agricultural land parcels, and during the process of classification each ilot is being given a parcel code depending on its type. The same process of classification is also taking place for subilots, where depending on the type of non-productive land, they are also being given a land use category code. During the digitization of ilots there are several factors that influence the process such as the delineation of those areas based on physical characteristics in compliance with the priority of those characteristics as well as the adaptation of certain rules of geometry. Another difficult process of high value during the update of LPIS data is the determination of the percentage reduction that should be applied to indicate the ineligible areas within the pasture lands and the identification and delineation of the corresponding subilots. The entire process of LPIS update is based on a GIS (an example application using Arc/Info GIS is included) in which through remote sensing and multi-criteria evaluation techniques the process of updating of the above data is being implemented with great success and high levels of accuracy.",2018,5,0,10.1117/12.2326214,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26db6bd99736136978ec56d0e3da092e891f2cdc,Conference,International Conference on Remote Sensing and Geoinformation of Environment
2b0d90af12f959b29fed9afefe90f54b4e0324cd,Research and development in agricultural robotics: a perspective of digital farming.,"Digital farming is the practice of modern technologies such as sensors, robotics, and data analysis for shifting from tedious operations to continuously automated processes. This paper reviews some of the latest achievements in agricultural robotics, specifically those that are used for autonomous weed control, field scouting, and harvesting. Object identification, task planning algorithms, digitalization and optimization of sensors are highlighted as some of the facing challenges in the context of digital farming. The concepts of multi-robots, human-robot collaboration, and environment reconstruction from aerial images and ground-based sensors for the creation of virtual farms were highlighted as some of the gateways of digital farming. It was shown that one of the trends and research focuses in agricultural field robotics is towards building a swarm of small scale robots and drones that collaborate together to optimize farming inputs and reveal denied or concealed information. For the case of robotic harvesting, an autonomous framework with several simple axis manipulators can be faster and more efficient than the currently adapted professional expensive manipulators. While robots are becoming the inseparable parts of the modern farms, our conclusion is that it is not realistic to expect an entirely automated farming system in the future.

4f70fc70673793abe054e252446d64c58749e774,Simulation software and virtual environments for acceleration of agricultural robotics: Features highlights and performance comparison,"Research efforts for development of agricultural robots that can effectively perform tedious field tasks have grown significantly in the past decade. Agricultural robots are complex systems that require interdisciplinary collaborations between different research groups for effective task delivery in unstructured crops and plants environments. With the exception of milking robots, the extensive research works that have been carried out in the past two decades for adaptation of robotics in agriculture have not yielded a commercial product to date. To accelerate this pace, simulation approach and evaluation methods in virtual environments can provide an affordable and reliable framework for experimenting with different sensing and acting mechanisms in order to verify the performance functionality of the robot in dynamic scenarios. This paper reviews several professional simulators and custom-built virtual environments that have been used for agricultural robotic applications. The key features and performance efficiency of three selected simulators were also compared. A simulation case study was demonstrated to highlight some of the powerful functionalities of the Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform. Details of the objects and scenes were presented as the proof-of-concept for using a completely simulated robotic platform and sensing systems in a virtual citrus orchard. It was shown that the simulated workspace can provide a configurable and modular prototype robotic system that is capable of adapting to several field conditions and tasks through easy testing and debugging of control algorithms with zero damage risk to the real robot and to the actual equipment. This review suggests that an open-source software platform for agricultural robotics will significantly accelerate effective collaborations between different research groups for sharing existing workspaces, algorithms, and reusing the materials.

Internet of Things (IoT) enables various applications (crop growth monitoring and selection, irrigation decision support, etc.) in Digital Agriculture domain. The Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) is widely used to build decision support systems. These systems overcome many problems in the real-world. One of the most interesting fields having an increasing need of decision support systems is Precision Agriculture (PA). Through sensor networks, agriculture can be connected to the IoT, which allows us to create connections among agronomists, farmers and crops regardless of their geographical differences. With the help of this approach which provides real-time information about the lands and crops that will help farmers make right decisions.

775272b11cbd8422f2e943cb861141699a55274e,High-Throughput Plant Phenotyping for Developing Novel Biostimulants: From Lab to Field or From Field to Lab?,"Plant biostimulants which include bioactive substances (humic acids, protein hydrolysates and seaweed extracts) and microorganisms (mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria of strains belonging to the genera Azospirillum, Azotobacter, and Rhizobium spp.) are gaining prominence in agricultural systems because of their potential for improving nutrient use efficiency, tolerance to abiotic stressors, and crop quality. Highly accurate non-destructive phenotyping techniques have attracted the interest of scientists and the biostimulant industry as an efficient means for elucidating the mode of biostimulant activity. High-throughput phenotyping technologies successfully employed in plant breeding and precision agriculture, could prove extremely useful in unraveling biostimulant-mediated modulation of key quantitative traits and would also facilitate the screening process for development of effective biostimulant products in controlled environments and field conditions. This perspective article provides an innovative discussion on how small, medium, and large high-throughput phenotyping platforms can accelerate efforts for screening numerous biostimulants and understanding their mode of action thanks to pioneering sensor and image-based phenotyping techniques. Potentiality and constraints of small-, medium-, and large-scale screening platforms are also discussed. Finally, the perspective addresses two screening approaches, “lab to field” and “field to lab,” used, respectively, by small/medium and large companies for developing novel and effective second generation biostimulant products.",2018,152,5,10.3389/fpls.2018.01197,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/775272b11cbd8422f2e943cb861141699a55274e,JournalArticle,Frontiers in Plant Science
812d606c6095ef2bf40d721b6a5894a8e83b3609,Closed Loop Controlled Precision Irrigation Sensor Network,"A closed loop irrigation system is demonstrated that fully automates the delivery of irrigation and calculates the water requirement from satellite images. The system optimizes water delivery for 140 cells located across four hectares of land based on two independent objectives (e.g., maximizing yield and increasing water efficiency) and is continuously adapting irrigation scheduling to the local spatial–temporal variability of the vegetation across the growing season. Irrigation is controlled by a central computer that issues commands to 693 control nodes to start irrigation based on the analysis of satellite images. The control nodes are laid out to create 15 m  $\times15$  m cells and each cell can be addressed independently and can irrigate differentially. After two years of operation, this variable rate drip irrigation approach resulted in a 26% yield increase in the second year and an average increase of 16% in water use efficiency. This paper demonstrates that combining closed loop automation and advanced irrigation analytics can improve the water use efficiency and increase the yield on existing agricultural lands.",2018,35,0,10.1109/JIOT.2018.2865527,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/812d606c6095ef2bf40d721b6a5894a8e83b3609,JournalArticle,IEEE Internet of Things Journal
b53427a22baf0aeab746ad9029d3a67a07560331,"Deploying multispectral remote sensing for multi‐temporal analysis of archaeological crop stress at Ravenshall, Fife, Scotland","Diminishing returns of archaeological crop marks in lowland areas from traditional observer‐directed visible spectrum aerial survey with standard photographic cameras highlights a need to explore alternative approaches to maintain the effectiveness of survey programmes. Developments in low‐cost multispectral remote sensing have in part been driven by the growth of precision agriculture and, whilst contributing to the intensification of land use, these technologies may offer new spectral and temporal capacities for detecting, recording and monitoring historic landscapes. However, there are significant challenges to the deployment of such approaches, not least the costs of data acquisition and uncertainty about the best conditions for data collection. This study assesses the effectiveness of the Parrot Sequoia, a relatively low‐cost multispectral sensor recently developed for agricultural applications, for the detection of crop marks to inform archaeological survey. A series of observations were taken with the sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at Ravenshall, Fife, Scotland, between April and July 2017. The resulting reflectance maps are compared to red, green and blue (RGB) photographs taken with a Nikon D800E digital camera during seven light aircraft surveys, with the aim of testing the sensors' comparative ability to record crop mark developments over time. The contrast in reflectance between vegetation samples growing over buried archaeological remains and the surrounding field was assessed through separability in regional histogram values across different image band combinations. Separable values indicative of crop marks were found in both the multispectral and RGB results from June 2017 onwards. Several vegetation index (VI) maps, particularly the Simple Ratio (SR) and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), were found to be effective for distinguishing crop marks in the multispectral results. The Sequoia is a cost‐effective sensor offering improved spectral resolution over the RGB photographs, showing potential for subtle crop mark detection across compact study areas.",2018,54,1,10.1002/arp.1721,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b53427a22baf0aeab746ad9029d3a67a07560331,Review,Archaeological Prospection

A complete enantioseparation of carfentrazone-ethyl and its chiral metabolite carfentrazone enantiomers was obtained using a chiral column. The absolute configuration and specific optical rotation of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone enantiomers were first confirmed as peaks 1, 2, 3, and 4: S-(+)-carfentrazone, R-(-)-carfentrazone, S-(-)-carfentrazone-ethyl, and R-(+)-carfentrazone-ethyl, respectively. The specificity, matrix effect, linearity, precision, accuracy, and stability were surveyed to evaluate the feasibility of the method. The mean recovery was in the range of 77.5-102.8% with relative standard deviations of 0.4-9.8% for the samples. The limits of detection of the enantiomers were evaluated as 0.7 to 6.0 μg/kg, and the limits of quantification were 2.5 to 20 μg/kg. The stereoselective degradation of carfentrazone-ethyl and carfentrazone in rice plant was investigated, and there was no clear enantioselectivity for carfentrazone-ethyl. As for carfentrazone, the enantiomer fractions value reached 0.85 at 7 days after spraying. The developed method was simple and reliable enough for the corresponding risk assessment of carfentrazone-ethyl and its metabolite enantiomers in crop plants, cereal grains, and soil samples.",2018,11,1,10.1002/jssc.201701349,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b87ca30c04325d0f9c97b645f9df1d82f7c4ceda,"JournalArticle,Review",Journal of Separation Science

Visual assessment by human raters is time-consuming, expensive, and error prone. Disease rating and plant protection need new and innovative techniques to address forthcoming challenges and trends in agricultural production that require more precision than ever before. Within this context, hyperspectral sensors and imaging techniques-intrinsically tied to efficient data analysis approaches-have shown an enormous potential to provide new insights into plant-pathogen interactions and for the detection of plant diseases. This article provides an overview of hyperspectral sensors and imaging technologies for assessing compatible and incompatible plant-pathogen interactions.

1f4c7ea31572183903975ad244387812cd3e1b63,Joint Alternate Small Convolution and Feature Reuse for Hyperspectral Image Classification,"A hyperspectral image (HSI) contains fine and rich spectral information and spatial information of ground objects, which has great potential in applications. It is also widely used in precision agriculture, marine monitoring, military reconnaissance and many other fields. In recent years, a convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully used in HSI classification and has provided it with outstanding capacity for improving classification effects. To get rid of the bondage of strong correlation among bands for HSI classification, an effective CNN architecture is proposed for HSI classification in this work. The proposed CNN architecture has several distinct advantages. First, each 1D spectral vector that corresponds to a pixel in an HSI is transformed into a 2D spectral feature matrix, thereby emphasizing the difference among samples. In addition, this architecture can not only weaken the influence of strong correlation among bands on classification, but can also fully utilize the spectral information of hyperspectral data. Furthermore, a 1 × 1 convolutional layer is adopted to better deal with HSI information. All the convolutional layers in the proposed CNN architecture are composed of small convolutional kernels. Moreover, cascaded composite layers of the architecture consist of 1 × 1 and 3 × 3 convolutional layers. The inputs and outputs of each composite layer are stitched as the inputs of the next composite layer, thereby accomplishing feature reuse. This special module with joint alternate small convolution and feature reuse can extract high-level features from hyperspectral data meticulously and comprehensively solve the overfitting problem to an extent, in order to obtain a considerable classification effect. Finally, global average pooling is used to replace the traditional fully connected layer to reduce the model parameters and extract high-dimensional features from the hyperspectral data at the end of the architecture. Experimental results on three benchmark HSI datasets show the high classification accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.",2018,41,1,10.3390/ijgi7090349,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f4c7ea31572183903975ad244387812cd3e1b63,JournalArticle,ISPRS Int.

High resolution orbital sensors have limitations such as temporal resolution and cloud cover. The RPA (Remotely Piloted Aircraft) appears as an option to assist in Precision Agriculture, since the acquisition of the images can be decided according to the need of the study of the planting and, therefore, no longer having the limitation of the temporal resolution of imaging. In addition, the cloud cover problem is no longer a problem as there is the advantage of being able to plan the flight to a lower altitude than the clouds present in the area.

Wide spectrum toxic chemicals are being used to remove pestcides and salvage crops and economies linked to agriculture. The burden on the environment, public health and economy is huge. Traditional pestcide control is based on administering heavy loads of highly toxic compounds and elements that essentially strip all life from the field. Those chemicals are a leading cause of increased cancer related deaths in countryside. Herein, the Trojan horse of endosymbiosis was used, in an effort to control pests using high specificity compounds in reduced quantities. Materials and Methods: Our pipeline has been applied on the case of Otiorhynchus singularis, which is a very widespread pest, whose impact is devastating on a repertoire of crops. To date, there is no specific pesticide nor agent to control it. The deployed strategy involves the inhibition of the key DSB-A enzyme of its endosymbiotic Wolbachia pipientis bacterial strain. Results: Our methodology, provides the means to design, test and identify highly specific pestcide control substances that minimize the impact of toxic chemicals on health, economy and the environment.

This allows greater accuracy in targeting the correct amount of inputs, at the correct time, and in the correct location compared to conventional agricultural methods. As such, precision agriculture has significant potential to reduce agricultural inputs, enhance agricultural sustainability, and increase production in order to meet the growing worldwide demand for food. This study focuses on southern Alberta, the largest, most fertile and productive agricultural region in Canada. Given the high concentration of agriculture in this region, the potential benefits of precision agriculture could be significant. A greater understanding of the adoption of precision agriculture is therefore warranted. Based on a survey of farmers, the study finds the region is actively advancing PA technologies and the findings indicate PA technologies tend to be spread across all land and crop types; the technologies are applied to both dryland and irrigated farms and across cereals, oilseeds and speciality crops. Farmers are highly satisfied with precision agriculture and intend to continue adoption of precision agriculture technologies. Further, some non-adopters intend to become adopters. If there are limits to adoption it is because some farms are too small to warrant the adoption of precision agriculture and the attendant high investment costs.",2018,9,0,10.2495/SDP180301,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/326c0a98bf63d7fe43301daa3467e0624093e907,Review,Sustainable Development and Planning X

69d1feabd8573c193ef5d24813eb5f4072a31a8e,Creation and Characterization of a Genomically Hybrid Strain in the Nitrogen-Fixing Symbiotic Bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti.,"Many bacteria, often associated with eukaryotic hosts and of relevance for biotechnological applications, harbor a multipartite genome composed of more than one replicon. Biotechnologically relevant phenotypes are often encoded by genes residing on the secondary replicons. A synthetic biology approach to developing enhanced strains for biotechnological purposes could therefore involve merging pieces or entire replicons from multiple strains into a single genome. Here we report the creation of a genomic hybrid strain in a model multipartite genome species, the plant-symbiotic bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. We term this strain as cis-hybrid, since it is produced by genomic material coming from the same species' pangenome. In particular, we moved the secondary replicon pSymA (accounting for nearly 20% of total genome content) from a donor S. meliloti strain to an acceptor strain. The cis-hybrid strain was screened for a panel of complex phenotypes (carbon/nitrogen utilization phenotypes, intra- and extracellular metabolomes, symbiosis, and various microbiological tests). Additionally, metabolic network reconstruction and constraint-based modeling were employed for in silico prediction of metabolic flux reorganization. Phenotypes of the cis-hybrid strain were in good agreement with those of both parental strains. Interestingly, the symbiotic phenotype showed a marked cultivar-specific improvement with the cis-hybrid strains compared to both parental strains. These results provide a proof-of-principle for the feasibility of genome-wide replicon-based remodelling of bacterial strains for improved biotechnological applications in precision agriculture.",2018,32,0,10.1021/acssynbio.8b00158,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69d1feabd8573c193ef5d24813eb5f4072a31a8e,JournalArticle,ACS Synthetic Biology

In this study, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with Red Green Blue (RGB) and multispectral cameras was used to acquire a series of field images at the flowering stage, and the flower number was manually counted as a reference. Images of the rape field were first classified using K-means method based on Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE) L*a*b* space, and the result showed that classified flower coverage area (FCA) possessed a high correlation with the flower number (r2 = 0.89). The relationships between ten commonly used vegetation indices (VIs) extracted from UAV-based RGB and multispectral images and the flower number were investigated, and the VIs of Normalized Green Red Difference Index (NGRDI), Red Green Ratio Index (RGRI) and Modified Green Red Vegetation Index (MGRVI) exhibited the highest correlation to the flower number with the absolute correlation coefficient (r) of 0.91. Random forest (RF) model was developed to predict the flower number, and a good performance was achieved with all UAV variables (r2 = 0.93 and RMSEP = 16.18), while the optimal subset regression (OSR) model was further proposed to simplify the RF model, and a better result with r2 = 0.95 and RMSEP = 14.13 was obtained with the variable combination of RGRI, normalized difference spectral index (NDSI (944, 758)) and FCA. Our findings suggest that combining VIs and image classification from UAV-based RGB and multispectral images possesses the potential of estimating flower number in oilseed rape.",2018,127,5,10.3390/RS10091484,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93270f45924ee7c7fd6eb6ec534216dc75789736,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

Canopy leaf biomass (CLB) per ground area is one of the key crop phenotypic parameters in plant breeding. The most promising technique for effectively monitoring CLB is the hyperspectral vegetation index (VI). However, VI-based empirical models are limited by their poor stability and extrapolation difficulties when used to assess complex dynamic environments with different varieties, growth stages, and sites. It has been proven difficult to calibrate and validate some VI-based models. To address this problem, eight field experiments using eight wheat varieties were conducted during the period of 2003–2011 at four sites, and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was applied to estimate CLB from large number of field experimental data. The analysis of 108 wavelet functions from all 15 wavelet families revealed that the best wavelet features for CLB in terms of wavelength (W) and scale (S) were observed in the near-infrared region and at high scales (7 and 8). The best wavelet-based model was derived from the Daubechies family (db), and was named db7 (W1197 nm, S8). The new model was more accurate (Rv2 = 0.67 and RRMSE = 27.26%) than a model obtained using the best existing VI (Rv2 = 0.54 and RRMSE = 34.71%). Furthermore, the stable performance of the optimal db7 wavelet feature was confirmed by its limited variation among the different varieties, growth stages, and sites, which confirmed the high stability of the CWT to estimate CLB with hyperspectral data. This study highlighted the potential of precision phenotyping to assess the dynamic genetics of complex traits, especially those not amenable to traditional phenotyping.",2018,32,0,10.3389/fpls.2018.01360,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7504afcbe96266f0cc4c16565e51b24f38820e96,JournalArticle,Frontiers in Plant Science

These algorithms play a major role in efficient use of UAVs or other autonomous vehicles for precision agriculture, large area monitoring or security use cases. These algorithms are either centralized and in need of constant connection with the agents or solve NP-hard problems to plan the routes of individual agents on the graph. These requirements become unfeasible when the number of agents or points of interest grow or become dynamic. In this article we further elaborate the performance characteristics of the Partition Based Patrolling Strategy (PBPS) algorithm. The partitioning requires only local interactions between agents, therefore it is scalable to a large number of nodes and agents.

e7fb2de4ed327a53b66f430484a669745b12a662,Potential Bands of Sentinel-2A Satellite for Classification Problems in Precision Agriculture,"Various indices are used for assessing vegetation and soil properties in satellite remote sensing applications. Some indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), are capable of simply differentiating crop vitality and water stress. Nowadays, remote sensing capabilities with high spectral, spatial and temporal resolution are available to analyse classification problems in precision agriculture. Many challenges in precision agriculture can be addressed by supervised classification, such as crop type classification, disease and stress (e.g., grass, water and nitrogen) monitoring. Instead of performing classification based on designated indices, this paper explores direct classification using different bands information as features. Land cover classification by using the recently launched Sentinel-2A image is adopted as a case study to validate our method. Four approaches of featured band selection are compared to classify five classes (crop, tree, soil, water and road) with the support vector machines (SVMs) algorithm, where the first approach utilizes traditional empirical indices as features and the latter three approaches adopt specific bands (red, near infrared and short wave infrared) related to indices, specific bands after ranking by mutual information (MI), and full bands of on board sensors as features, respectively. It is shown that a better classification performance can be achieved by directly using the selected bands after MI ranking compared with the one using empirical indices and specific bands related to indices, while the use of all 13 bands can marginally improve the classification accuracy than MI based one. Therefore, it is recommended that this approach can be applied for specific Sentinel-2A image classification problems in precision agriculture.",2018,63,2,10.1007/s11633-018-1143-x,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7fb2de4ed327a53b66f430484a669745b12a662,JournalArticle,International Journal of Automation and Computing

A 2015 survey of agricultural retailers examined the minimum educational requirements retailers were seeking in their hires, along with the importance of a list of KSAs for the various positions that they customarily fill. The positions included equipment operators, sales specialists, technical support, and agronomists. The KSAs included specifics, such as the ability to install, calibrate, troubleshoot, and repair equipment; knowledge of precision agriculture software; and also more broad skills such as effective written and verbal communication and in making agronomy recommendations. As expected, retailers expressed different educational minimums and different levels of importance for various positions.

However, for UAS-based data to be used as an industry standard for assessing tree structure and condition as well as production parameters, it is imperative that the appropriate data collection and pre-processing protocols are established to enable multi-temporal comparison. There are several UAS-based radiometric correction methods commonly used for precision agricultural purposes. However, their relative accuracies have not been assessed for data acquired in complex horticultural environments. This study assessed the variations in estimated surface reflectance values of different radiometric corrections applied to multi-spectral UAS imagery acquired in both avocado and banana orchards. We found that inaccurate calibration panel measurements, inaccurate signal-to-reflectance conversion, and high variation in geometry between illumination, surface, and sensor viewing produced significant radiometric variations in at-surface reflectance estimates. Potential solutions to address these limitations included appropriate panel deployment, site-specific sensor calibration, and appropriate bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction. Future UAS-based horticultural crop monitoring can benefit from the proposed solutions to radiometric corrections to ensure they are using comparable image-based maps of multi-temporal biophysical properties.",2018,69,5,10.3390/rs10111684,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a32114210183e24098f1f84cc1983aee8c0a9a6,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing
103d00cf23186050c47b2942ccaba2ee0052b988,AgriColMap: Aerial-Ground Collaborative 3D Mapping for Precision Farming,"The combination of aerial survey capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with targeted intervention abilities of agricultural unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) can significantly improve the effectiveness of robotic systems applied to precision agriculture. In this context, building and updating a common map of the field is an essential but challenging task. The maps built using robots of different types show differences in size, resolution, and scale, the associated geolocation data may be inaccurate and biased while the repetitiveness of both visual appearance and geometric structures found within agricultural contexts render classical map merging techniques ineffective. In this letter, we propose AgriColMap, a novel map registration pipeline that leverages a grid-based multimodal environment representation, which includes a vegetation index map and a digital surface model. We cast the data association problem between maps built from UAVs and UGVs as a multimodal, large displacement dense optical flow estimation. The dominant, coherent flows, selected using a voting scheme, are used as point-to-point correspondences to infer a preliminary nonrigid alignment between the maps. A final refinement is then performed, by exploiting only meaningful parts of the registered maps. We evaluate our system using real-world data for three fields with different crop species. The results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art map registration and matching techniques by a large margin, and has a higher tolerance to large initial misalignments.

A negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor with high resistance tolerance is interfaced through a conditioning circuit to a 12-bit digital converter of a wireless microcontroller. The system is calibrated to minimize the effect of component uncertainties and achieves an accuracy of ±0.03 °C on average (±0.05 °C in worst cases) in a 5 °C to 45 °C range. The calibration process is based on a continuous temperature sweep, while calibration data are simultaneously logged to reduce the delays and cost of conventional calibration approaches. An uncertainty analysis is performed to support the validity of the reported performance results. The described approach for interfacing the thermistor to the hardware platform can be straightforwardly adjusted for different thermistors, temperature ranges/accuracy levels/resolutions, and voltage ranges. The low power communication combined with the energy consumption optimization adopted enable an operation to be autonomic for several months to years depending on the application’s measurement frequency requirements. The system cost is approximately $45 USD in components, while its design and compact size allow its integration with extended monitoring systems in various pervasive computing environments. The system has been thoroughly tested and validated in a field trial concerning a precision agriculture application and is currently used in a health monitoring application.",2018,29,1,10.3390/s18103445,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/160229d387b2d067e78dbb54e2288e347eb40955,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

However, guaranteeing stable communication between end devices and fog nodes is often not trivial. Indeed, in some application scenarios such as mining operations, building sites, precision agriculture, and more, communication occurs over Challenged Networks e.g., because of the absence of a fixed and reliable network infrastructure.

During transformation from traditional planting to smart planting, sensors in an agricultural IoT system have to produce similar results as traditional testing suites. In order to calibrate electrical conductivity (EC) sensors in the IoT system, finding a good regression method with its hyper-parameters is an expensive task. Although there are studies to investigate issues related to calibrating EC sensors, there does not exist a study to automatically find the best algorithm and hyper-parameters given constraints.

Since the population grows while the space for primary production remains limited, it is necessary to modify agricultural practice to fulfill all population needs. The concept of precision agriculture aims to utilize modern technologies to make the agriculture more effective. Maize is one of the crucial crops worldwide. However, its cultivation has a negative influence on the soil, because it depletes the nutrients and since the sewing distance is relatively high, the soil is also endangered by water or wind erosion. This study aimed to evaluate a 1.6 agricultural plot in North Sumatra, Indonesia, where there is maize cultivated in a very intensive mode. The influence of degraded soil on maize yield was the main issue. Soil sampling showed that there is only slightly lower amount of copper, otherwise the soil nutrients content are on optimal levels. Since there were no yield data evaluated, yield was estimated by calculating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index derived from free Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Four growing season were evaluated. Mean values of NDVI did not show any trend (0.579; 0.667; 0.621; 0.572). Four vegetation seasons seem to be a very short period to observe any significant results. Thus, this paper may be understood as a study with preliminary results that may be repeated in future to see potential influence of intensive maize cultivation on soil properties.",2018,2,0,10.1088/1757-899X/420/1/012076,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c0b888e0b7713934ce45fdfa4e425affe1e360fc,Conference,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering

In particular, irrigation activities can be optimized by collecting soil conditions using soil sensors to ensure water resource sustainability. While there are commercialized soil-monitoring systems, their cost is often too high for large-scale implementation. To guarantee water resource sustainability and food supply through irrigation optimization, large-scale deployments of soil sensors are required. Therefore, in this study, a cost-efficient soil monitoring device that employs capacitive touch sensing and printed electronics was developed. The target price of the proposed system that includes a sensor probe and a gateway is $1000. This is about three times cheaper than the commercially available systems and it is reasonably accurate. In India, irrigation optimization is essential to mitigate severe drought and water shortage caused by climate changes. Thus, to verify the usability of the proposed probes for irrigation management in a real farm field, the probes were tested in a maize field in Hyderabad.

e8ed736a9f434ef96ed5d3e3708b2161d5048e09,Power Reduction with Sleep/Wake on Redundant Data (SWORD) in a Wireless Sensor Network for Energy-Efficient Precision Agriculture,"The use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in modern precision agriculture to monitor climate conditions and to provide agriculturalists with a considerable amount of useful information is currently being widely considered. However, WSNs exhibit several limitations when deployed in real-world applications. One of the challenges faced by WSNs is prolonging the life of sensor nodes. This challenge is the primary motivation for this work, in which we aim to further minimize the energy consumption of a wireless agriculture system (WAS), which includes air temperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. Two power reduction schemes are proposed to decrease the power consumption of the sensor and router nodes. First, a sleep/wake scheme based on duty cycling is presented. Second, the sleep/wake scheme is merged with redundant data about soil moisture, thereby resulting in a new algorithm called sleep/wake on redundant data (SWORD). SWORD can minimize the power consumption and data communication of the sensor node. A 12 V/5 W solar cell is embedded into the WAS to sustain its operation. Results show that the power consumption of the sensor and router nodes is minimized and power savings are improved by the sleep/wake scheme. The power consumption of the sensor and router nodes is improved by 99.48% relative to that in traditional operation when the SWORD algorithm is applied. In addition, data communication in the SWORD algorithm is minimized by 86.45% relative to that in the sleep/wake scheme. The comparison results indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform power reduction techniques proposed in other studies. The average current consumptions of the sensor nodes in the sleep/wake scheme and the SWORD algorithm are 0.731 mA and 0.1 mA, respectively.",2018,39,4,10.3390/s18103450,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e8ed736a9f434ef96ed5d3e3708b2161d5048e09,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

In this letter, we focus on pixel-based approaches for classification of crops versus weeds, especially for complex cases involving overlapping plants and partial occlusion. We examine the benefits of multiscale and content-driven morphology-based descriptors called attribute profiles. These are compared to the state-of-the-art keypoint descriptors with a fixed neighborhood previously used in precision agriculture, namely histograms of oriented gradients and local binary patterns. The proposed classification technique is especially advantageous when coupled with morphology-based segmentation on a max-tree structure, as the same representation can be reused for feature extraction. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated by an experimental evaluation on two datasets with different crop types, while being able to provide descriptors at a higher resolution. The proposed approach compared favorably to the state-of-the-art approaches without an increase in computational complexity, while being able to provide descriptors at a higher resolution.",2018,35,1,10.1109/LRA.2018.2848305,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f36ce6b107b0cef1b76f18fa77351128201109da,JournalArticle,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters

Retrieval of biochemical parameters using satellite data can prove to be a boon in terms of agricultural monitoring. Sentinel-2 data provide highly accurate spatial and temporal data, thus holds great potential for many agricultural related applications such as vegetation classification, identification of vegetation state, analysis of vegetation health, etc. But it is still a very challenging task for the researchers to identify different biochemical parameters of crop plants with the help of Sentinel-2 data. In this study, an attempt has been made to derive the relation between Sentinel-2 data and biochemical parameters of Sugarcane crop plants. For analyzing the relation between satellite data and biochemical parameters of crop plants, first we have calculated the reflectance values for band 2, band 3, band 4, and band 8 of Sentinel-2 images and then we have analyzed the biochemical parameters of sugarcane crop plants such as chlorophyll, carbohydrate, protein, hydrogen peroxide, phenol and proline using leaf samples. Finally, statistical analysis is done to find out the sensitivity of reflectance values for plant parameters. With the help of statistical analysis we have found out that reflectance values of band 2 (blue band) show sensitivity to phenol content in sugarcane crop plants and similarly reflectance value of band 8 (NIR band) show sensitivity for chlorophyll content.",2018,2,0,10.1109/INFOCOMTECH.2018.8722386,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f42c1b02936be798aac8b35715411047fe0432a8,Conference,Conference Information and Communication Technology

After 16 years, I have decided to step down to devote time to other endeavors. I have enjoyed the opportunity to work with such a capable team of review and column editors over the years and thank the numerous contributors who have chosen JAFI as a publication venue, building its international audience and reputation. Longtime Editorial Board member Leslie M. Delserone, Science and Government Information Librarian at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, will assume the role of Editor-in-Chief. The issue opens with a Society of the Quarter column by Jessica Page profiling the American Farmland Trust, an organization dedicated to preserving farmland, keeping farmers on the land, and supporting local agriculture and the environment. Its matterof-fact slogan, “No Farms, No Food” captures the importance of its mission. In the lead refereed article, Jason West presents the sobering scenario of cyberattacks on the modern digital farm, reliant on an array of sensors, transmitters, wireless networks, and other technologies for water management, crop production, livestock tracking, etc. The author proposes a threat prediction model and decision framework to quantify vulnerabilities and risk and derive customized, preventative strategies for cyberattacks to precision agriculture systems. Two articles analyze the use of social media in the agricultural domain. Pawandeep Kaushik, Ataharul Chowdhury, Helen Hambly Odame, and Annemarie van Passen assess the use of Facebook and Twitter by four agri-food stakeholders in Ontario, Canada to foster communication and networking. Their findings document a beneficial role for social media but suggest it also serve as a driver of face-to-face, “offline” interactions not just passive, online exchanges. Victor Otene, Jacob Okwu, and Agada Agene examine Nigerian farmers’ and extension agents’ utilization of Facebook to gauge its viability as a future communication medium. Results show higher Facebook use by agents than farmers, but major infrastructural constraints (poor network service, power failures) limit effective use by either group. In the face of such digital barriers, it is not surprising that radio, on the opposite end of the Information Communication Technology spectrum, remains an important agricultural information tool, as our next two contributions show. George Adamides and Andreas Stylianou evaluate listenership to a popular Cypriot radio broadcast which serves as a source of extension information. Idris Badiru and Nsikakabasi Akpabio study the audience and utilization of an agricultural radio program in Nigeria. While the authors’ analyses report differing levels of listenership, they both validate continued investment in radio as a vehicle for information dissemination, especially in rural and remote areas of the country.

28331cbfbf0017d2ea444505bc27161a4b3b687b,"Impact of Robust Estimators on Variance Estimation in Survey Sampling, Using Conventional and Non-Conventional Parameters as Auxiliary Information","Variance estimation has great scope in the fields like medical sciences, Agricultural and Horticultural sciences, Biological sciences and Industries etc. In the field of medical sciences, a physician needs to have the knowledge about the levels of variations like pulse rate, body temperature and blood pressure to prescribe the suitable treatment. Similarly an agriculturalist needs the knowledge about the levels of variations like soil fertility variation, genetic variations and climatic variations to plant the crop. Thus variations are present everywhere in our day to day life. In order to obtain the precise and valid estimates, we have proposed new estimators for the estimation of finite population variance. Various authors have generalized many estimators such as Isaki (1983), who introduced the ratio and regression estimator, Kadilar and Cingi (2006a), who searched the estimators by utilizing the coefficient of skewkness as supplementary information to enhance the efficiency of estimator. Upadhya and Singh (1999) incorporated the coefficient of kurtosis as auxiliary information to improve the efficiency of estimators over existing estimators. Similarly Bhat et al., (2018) have used linear combination of skewness and quartiles as auxiliary information to obtain the precision of estimators.

Currently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery are being assessed for analyzing within field spatial variability for agricultural precision management, because UAV imagery may be acquired quickly during critical periods of rapid crop growth. This study refers to the derivation of highland Kimchi cabbage growth prediction equation by using UAV derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and agro-meteorological factors. Anbandeok area in Gangneung, Gangwon-do, Korea is one of main producing district of highland Kimchi cabbage. UAV imagery was taken on the Anbandeok twelve times from early June to early September during the highland Kimchi cabbage growing season. Meanwhile, field reflectance spectra and three plant growth parameters, including plant height (P.H.), leaf height (L.H.) and leaf number (L.N.), were measured for about 40 plants (ten plants per plot) for each ground survey. The NDVIField for each of the 40 plants was measured using an active plant growth sensor (Crop CircleTM) at the same time. Six agro-meteorological factors include average temperature; maximum temperature; minimum temperature; accumulated temperature; rainfall and irradiation. The multiple linear regression models were suggested by using stepwise regression in the extraction of independent variables. Of the output independent variables of the stepwise regression, NDVIUAV performs best (r=0.933). And correlation coefficients of highland Kimchi cabbage growth parameters, accumulated temperature, irradiation and rainfall showed positive relationship; the results were respectively 0.931, 0.926, 0.893 (p<0.01). But minimum temperature had negative relationship; the results were respectively -0.789 (p<0.01). NDVIUAV and rainfall in the model explain 93% of the P.H. and L.H. with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.22, 1.90 cm. And NDVIUAV and accumulated temperature in the model explain 86% of the L.N. with a RMSE of 4.29. These lead to the result that the characteristics of variations in highland Kimchi cabbage growth according to NDVIUAV and other agro-meteorological factors were well reflected in the model. These results will also be useful in determining the UAV multi-spectral imagery necessary to estimate parameters of highland Kimchi cabbage.",2018,0,0,10.1117/12.2326268,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/809c00b903c3914c97f8c311f3ab5bc774bf1366,Review,Remote Sensing

Temperature is a key metric in these settings that is used to inform and actuate farm operations such as irrigation scheduling, frost damage mitigation, and greenhouse management. Using cheap single-board computers as temperature sensors can drive down the cost of sensing in these applications and make it possible to monitor a large number of micro-climates concurrently. We have developed a system in which devices communicate their CPU measurements to an on-farm edge cloud. The edge cloud uses a combination of calibration, smoothing (noise removal), and linear regression to make predictions of the outdoor temperature at each device.

In other words, precision agriculture as part of geoinformatics. The aim is to quantify whether the adopted technology can improve the efficiency of agricultural fields management and production to attain food security. Therefore, views of targeted groups from different States of Sudan were investigated, using stratified sampling method. Where quantitative statistics (descriptive/inductive techniques) was applied. About 800 questionnaires were distributed. The outcomes of data analysis reflected that the majority of interviewed groups 357 (82.1%) do not know the principles and application of integrated technology in the field of agricultural management. 85.3% of respondents know nothing about computer program related to precision agriculture. The majority of the respondents (84.6 %), did not get courses on precision agriculture during the under graduate study. The result also revealed that only 11.8% of the respondents use modern techniques in land preparation, 16.1 % in soil analysis, 12.5 % in the field of seed technology, and 11.4% in crop harvesting. However, 53.9% of the respondents reported that their Departments did not care about training on agricultural precision. Nevertheless, 24.3 % of the respondents got trained on precision agriculture through personal efforts, while about 19% got trained by their respective Departments. In regard to education, 16% of the respondents got trained on precision agriculture at undergraduate and only 9% after graduation.

As such, metabolomic analysis produces a global biochemical phenotype. It is a technology that has been utilized in the research setting for over a decade. The metabolome is directly linked to and is influenced by genetics, epigenetics, environmental factors, and the microbiome-all of which affect health. Metabolomics can be applied to human clinical diagnostics and to other fields such as veterinary medicine, nutrition, exercise, physiology, agriculture/plant biochemistry, and toxicology. Applications of metabolomics in clinical testing are emerging, but several aspects of its use as a clinical test differ from applications focused on research or biomarker discovery and need to be considered for metabolomics clinical test data to have optimum impact, be meaningful, and be used responsibly. In this review, we deconstruct aspects and challenges of metabolomics for clinical testing by illustrating the significance of test design, accurate and precise data acquisition, quality control, data processing, n-of-1 comparison to a reference population, and biochemical pathway analysis. We describe how metabolomics technology is integral to defining individual biochemical phenotypes, elaborates on human health and disease, and fits within the precision medicine landscape.

Up to date, TRIA determination is performed by GC analysis after chemical derivatization, but in aqueous samples containing low amounts of TRIA determination can be problematic and the derivatization step can be troublesome. Hence, there is the need for an analysis method without derivatization. TRIA-based products are in general plant extracts that can be obtained with different extraction procedures. These products can contain different ranges of concentration of TRIA from units to thousands of mg/kg. Thus, there is the need for a method that can be applied to different sample matrices like plant materials and different plant extracts. In this paper we present a HPLC-ELSD method for the analysis of TRIA without derivatization. The method has been fully validated and it has been tested analyzing the content of TRIA in different dried vegetal matrices, plant extracts, and products. The method is characterized by high sensitivity (LOD = 0.2 mg/L, LOQ = 0.6 mg/L) and good precision (intra-day: <11.2%, inter-day: 10.2%) being suitable for routine analysis of this fatty alcohol both for quality control or research purposes.",2018,3,0,10.3390/molecules23112775,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dfffae1d31809d66e7b27b8373db51e89cd2a0e3,JournalArticle,Molecules
e0ed214707db6786ba4489b0922aeb5d5d4cdde4,Deep Learning with Unsupervised Data Labeling for Weed Detection in Line Crops in UAV Images,"In recent years, weeds have been responsible for most agricultural yield losses. To deal with this threat, farmers resort to spraying the fields uniformly with herbicides. This method not only requires huge quantities of herbicides but impacts the environment and human health. One way to reduce the cost and environmental impact is to allocate the right doses of herbicide to the right place and at the right time (precision agriculture). Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming an interesting acquisition system for weed localization and management due to their ability to obtain images of the entire agricultural field with a very high spatial resolution and at a low cost. However, despite significant advances in UAV acquisition systems, the automatic detection of weeds remains a challenging problem because of their strong similarity to the crops. Recently, a deep learning approach has shown impressive results in different complex classification problems. However, this approach needs a certain amount of training data, and creating large agricultural datasets with pixel-level annotations by an expert is an extremely time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose a novel fully automatic learning method using convolutional neuronal networks (CNNs) with an unsupervised training dataset collection for weed detection from UAV images. The proposed method comprises three main phases. First, we automatically detect the crop rows and use them to identify the inter-row weeds. In the second phase, inter-row weeds are used to constitute the training dataset. Finally, we perform CNNs on this dataset to build a model able to detect the crop and the weeds in the images. The results obtained are comparable to those of traditional supervised training data labeling, with differences in accuracy of 1.5% in the spinach field and 6% in the bean field.",2018,279,12,10.3390/RS10111690,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0ed214707db6786ba4489b0922aeb5d5d4cdde4,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

According to the results of the survey or inspection, a map of crops weediness is built, on the basis of which the exact application of herbicides is carried out. At the same time the development of new plant protection technologies is associated with the need for special studies aimed at identifying their practical widespread use. The study of the effectiveness of differentiated herbicide use for agricultural crops in crop rotation was carried out in 2003-2010 at the experimental site of the Mordovia Research Agricultural Institute with an area of 1 ha divided into 45 sectors. The research was carried out in crop rotation: winter wheat (test sowing) - spring wheat, annual grasses - spring barley - bare fallow - winter wheat - spring wheat. It has been established that weeds placement in the site areas was extremely uneven, that allowed carrying out herbicide application selectively in places with a high weediness level. Locally differentiated herbicides use in field crop rotation provided 29.4-37.0 % decrease in its consumption and at the same time did not lead to the increase of cultivated plants weediness. To identify the effectiveness of herbicides in field crop rotation an economic assessment was carried out, which revealed the advantage of differentiated application of herbicides over traditional use. In comparison with the traditional technology, the difference in the average cost of herbicide application was 134.56 rubles/ha, or 33.6 % decrease. Therefore, the differentiated herbicides use is a promising direction in the development of effective resource-saving technologies in agricultural production.",2018,2,0,10.30766/2072-9081.2018.66.5.83-89,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25376f1a28a0a386d5d001da315891e1e59b0a22,Review,

Nowadays using satellite images for field zoning has become a widely spread technique employed in precision agriculture. Usually satellite images are used to evaluate Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a common yield assessment. At the same time it is rather a challenging task to designing NDVI maps as compared to ordinary RGB images. We propose a new algorithm for site-specific zoning based on the performance of a well-known and widely used ICA algorithm (FastICA). We analyse high resolution RGB satellite images for 3 arable fields located in Kursk region, Russia, (2017) provided by the Planet Labs service. The main outcomes from this study are (i) the algorithm creates site-specific zoning maps with a relative accuracy of yield distribution maps between 0.78 and 0.89; (ii) the algorithm requires a relatively small dataset – from 8 to 10 RGB images.

477dac821d73c2865d3f3e2aedfdfe13f0661b93,Predicting Profile Soil Properties with Reflectance Spectra via Bayesian Covariate-Assisted External Parameter Orthogonalization,"In situ, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) profile soil sensors have the potential to provide both rapid and high-resolution prediction of multiple soil properties for precision agriculture, soil health assessment, and other applications related to environmental protection and agronomic sustainability. However, the effects of soil moisture, other environmental factors, and artefacts of the in-field spectral data collection process often hamper the utility of in situ DRS data. Various processing and modeling techniques have been developed to overcome these challenges, including external parameter orthogonalization (EPO) transformation of the spectra. In addition, Bayesian modeling approaches may improve prediction over traditional partial least squares (PLS) regression. The objectives of this study were to predict soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and texture fractions using a large, regional dataset of in situ profile DRS spectra and compare the performance of (1) traditional PLS analysis, (2) PLS on EPO-transformed spectra (PLS-EPO), (3) PLS-EPO with the Bayesian Lasso (PLS-EPO-BL), and (4) covariate-assisted PLS-EPO-BL models. In this study, soil cores and in situ profile DRS spectrometer scans were obtained to ~1 m depth from 22 fields across Missouri and Indiana, USA. In the laboratory, soil cores were split by horizon, air-dried, and sieved (<2 mm) for a total of 708 samples. Soil properties were measured and DRS spectra were collected on these air-dried soil samples. The data were randomly split into training (n = 308), testing (n = 200), and EPO calibration (n = 200) sets, and soil textural class was used as the categorical covariate in the Bayesian models. Model performance was evaluated using the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). For the prediction of soil properties using a model trained on dry spectra and tested on field moist spectra, the PLS-EPO transformation dramatically improved model performance relative to PLS alone, reducing RMSEP by 66% and 53% for SOC and TN, respectively, and by 76%, 91%, and 87% for clay, silt, and sand, respectively. The addition of the Bayesian Lasso further reduced RMSEP by 4–11% across soil properties, and the categorical covariate reduced RMSEP by another 2–9%. Overall, this study illustrates the strength of the combination of EPO spectral transformation paired with Bayesian modeling techniques to overcome environmental factors and in-field data collection artefacts when using in situ DRS data, and highlights the potential for in-field DRS spectroscopy as a tool for rapid, high-resolution prediction of soil properties.",2018,35,1,10.3390/s18113869,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/477dac821d73c2865d3f3e2aedfdfe13f0661b93,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

The platform consists of an IoT solution for monitoring the farming and irrigation systems combined with data analytic solution to assess the irrigation need of plants, and support for irrigation planning and water distribution both at farm and district level. CRITERIA-ID has been tested on two test cases for the Italian pilot, located in the land reclamation and irrigation consortium of Emilia Centrale (North Italy). The comparison of crop irrigation water needs computed by CRITERIA-ID with actual irrigation performed by farmers has been carried out, together with a comparison of crop water stress. The analysis has shown that for both the test cases the two data series are comparable, but some differences have been highlighted: in some cases the farmer irrigation is not decided on the basis of the actual water needs of the crops but on farm management decisions. In addition, if the total annual volumes of irrigation of the two series are comparable, the scheduling is different, where the observed irrigation data bring the crop to too high (or too low) level of water stress. Thus, the present work has shown that the application of CRITERIA-ID simulation model is a valid tool to support irrigation management because it allows an optimal use of the resource avoiding crop yield losses with a rational irrigation scheduling. The reliability of these outcomes sets the conditions for further exploitation of the model in the future, firstly for its integration into the SWAMP platform.",2018,10,1,10.23919/FRUCT.2018.8588079,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c235da31091956b795cf3a3d03fd29271b4a3b1,"JournalArticle,Conference",Conference of the Open Innovations Association

Therefore, in this paper an outdoor trajectory tracking system for a four wheel skid-steering vehicle is presented. The systems integrates an outdoor geolocation system with a tracking trajectory control system. The vehicle’s outdoor geolocation system was developed by fusing GPS (Global Positioning System), magetometer and wheel encoders position information. The sensor fusion algorithm was based on the EKF (Exended Kalman Filter) and the vehicle’s kinematic model. Afterwards, from top to bottom a tracking trajectory control system was designed and implemented as follows; first, a linear transfer function identification was carried out in order to model the response of the vehicle’s angular direction, then, a PID controller with a feedforward compensator for vehicle’s angular direction was designed. Finally, a trajectory generator as well as the trajectory tracking system were developed. The systems was implemented in a Raspberry PI-3 with an excellent processing performance.

These measures are paramount to ensure that the supply of food and agricultural products can withstand the increasing amount of demand from the increasing population. As computers continue to improve, the advent of applying the powers of the IoT in farming is within grasp. The research revolves around the framework and design of an internet enabled modular farming system that addresses the need for people to tend heavily on their growing crops. A network controls different components and continuously gathers data while transceiving with users. The setup, ideally situated in non-agricultural lands such as residential and commercial areas enable the person in charge to accomplish other tasks and leave the system to tend to the crops. The system will control factors such as temperature, light, relative humidity, and nutrient concentration in the water for the crops to grow under ideal conditions. The group believes that this will bring the farming into a new level, allowing every consumer to have their own vertical farming set-up in their own households without worrying about it thus eliminating their need to rely on food manufacturers.

In this context, there are different types of operational configurations for the WMR such as differential drive, Ackerman steering, omnidirectional or synchronous. For trajectory tracking tasks, the omnidirectional configuration is a good option since its holonomic characteristics offer greater freedom of movement and precision than the other configurations. The omnidirectional configuration requires an adequate control system to achieve the trajectory tracking, ensuring good performance regarding trajectory error.

Mars-Omics, Planetary Science, and the Next-Generation Technology Futurists","Abstract Omics technologies are key to research and innovation in human health, food and nutrition, drugs, agriculture, and ecology research. Yet, the actual scope of applications is much broader. One emerging possibility is planetary science driven in part by current debates on and possibilities for travel to Mars. In July 2018, radar evidence has suggested the presence of subglacial liquid water in a 20-km-wide zone, likely a saltwater lake, in the Planum Australe region in the south pole of Mars. If confirmed, this will be a promising place to search for microbial life on the red planet. Meanwhile, existential threats to life on earth such as climate change are bolstering the current interests by spacefaring nations for manned long-term space travel to other planets. A new global space industry is also on the rise; Mars-related technology innovation could potentially allow for rapid Earth-to-Earth transport as well, for example, in times of humanitarian and ecological crisis. Against this overarching context, we coin and define here the new concept of “Mars-omics”: the systems level study of how travel to and being on Mars affect human health, and how human presence on Mars impacts the life forms that might already be there, through changes such as space agriculture and other planetary transformations in Mars. Additionally, Mars-omics calls for new ways of thinking about scientific uncertainty and technology futures in such highly novel contexts. For example, how shall we frame scientific uncertainty when extrapolation of scientific unknowns across the planets is vastly difficult, nonlinear, and complex? Is uncertainty an accident or integral part of emerging technologies? These questions are important for achieving new relevance for and future progress in omics system science applications in planetary science and space explorations. In summary, this article suggests that omics has relevance in contexts beyond those on planet Earth. Moreover, past omics applications such as precision medicine may need to be reconceptualized in future novel settings, such as long-term space travel. We conclude the article with the key tenets of next-generation futurists in a context of Mars-omics.

Many short-term efforts are undertaken to conserve weed species, especially already endangered ones, but several years after expiration, eventually result in species-poor communities. Understanding drivers of community composition is key to prevent biodiversity loss. To understand the factors that shape weed communities and influence weed diversity and endangered weed species, we monitored conventional and organic cereal fields in two regions of southwestern Germany. A redundancy analysis was performed on vegetation recordings and data from a farmer survey. Crop species, herbicide use, farming system, nitrogen, and light availability had the strongest impact on weed diversity. The weed communities were dominated by Alopecurus myosuroides, Galium aparine, Viola arvensis, Polygonum convolvulus, and Veronica persica, and were mainly shaped by crop species, tillage, location in the field, and timing of herbicide application. Bromus grossus and Bromus secalinus, two endangered weed species, survived in conventional field margins as a result of the use of herbicides with gaps for Bromus species. Conservation efforts are not restricted to organic farming and should consider the major drivers of weed communities.

Citrus fruits are widely consumed around the world. Several elements are known to have important physiological functions in living things, whereas others are reported to have toxic effects. This study was aimed to analyze the concentration of macro, micro and trace elements in citrus fruit varieties. Samples were acid digested using a microwave system and analyzed for macro elements by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and for micro and trace elements by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The application of analytical techniques was analyzed by determining method validation parameters including limits of detection and quantification, linearity, precision, spiking experiments and analyzing certified reference material (NIST CRM-1570a), Spinach leaves.


RESULTS
The elemental levels of citrus fruits were found largely to be dependent upon the type of analyzed samples. Among nutritionally important elements, citrus fruits were good sources of potassium (95.13-270.4 mg kg-1 ), calcium (10.57-75.29 mg kg-1 ), zinc (466.5-1611 µg kg-1 ) and manganese (35.35-1902 µg kg-1 ). The concentrations of toxic elements (Pb, Cd, As, Al, Hg) were very low.


CONCLUSION
In general, the concentrations of analyzed elements were within the critical levels specified by the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization and Food and Nutrition Board USA. Linear discriminant analysis successfully separated the samples into clear groups with 93.9% correct classification. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.",2018,50,0,10.1002/jsfa.9382,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/828cf7373c484c7b8f336ec0251a1cdd7114ce37,JournalArticle,The Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture

8b714b17f0e3a70e5a59765b5b7af87532fe8fb0,Clustering Field-Based Maize Phenotyping of Plant-Height Growth and Canopy Spectral Dynamics Using a UAV Remote-Sensing Approach,"Phenotyping under field environmental conditions is often considered as a bottleneck in crop breeding. Unmanned aerial vehicle high throughput phenotypic platform (UAV-HTPP) mounted with multi-sensors offers an efficiency, non-invasive, flexible and low-cost solution in large-scale breeding programs compared to ground investigation, especially where measurements are time-sensitive. This study was conducted at the research station of the Xiao Tangshan National Precision Agriculture Research Center of China. Using the UAV-HTPP, RGB and multispectral images were acquired during four critical growth stages of maize. We present a method of extracting plant height (PH) at the plot scale using UAV-HTPP based on the spatial structure of the maize canopy. The core steps of this method are segmentation and spatial Kriging interpolation based on multiple neighboring maximum pixels from multiple plants in a plot. Then, the relationships between the PH extracted from imagery collected using UAV-HTPP and the ground truth were examined. We developed a semi-automated pipeline for extracting, analyzing and evaluating multiple phenotypic traits: canopy cover (CC), normalized vegetation index (NDVI), PH, average growth rate of plant height (AGRPH), and contribution rate of plant height (CRPH). For these traits, we identify genotypic differences and analyze and evaluate dynamics and development trends during different maize growth stages. Furthermore, we introduce a time series data clustering analysis method into breeding programs as a tool to obtain a novel representative trait: typical curve. We classified and named nine types of typical curves of these traits based on curve morphological features. We found that typical curves can detect differences in the genetic background of traits. For the best results, the recognition rate of an NDVI typical curve is 59%, far less than the 82.3% of the CRPH typical curve. Our study provides evidence that the PH trait is among the most heritable and the NDVI trait is among the most easily affected by the external environment in maize.",2018,107,2,10.3389/fpls.2018.01638,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b714b17f0e3a70e5a59765b5b7af87532fe8fb0,JournalArticle,Frontiers in Plant Science

80d0176be685c22118750b5ccf4a251075284de3,High resolution satellite imaging sensors for precision agriculture,"The central concept of precision agriculture is to manage within-field soil and crop growth variability for more efficient use of farming inputs. Remote sensing has been an integral part of precision agriculture since the farming technology started developing in the mid to late 1980s. Various types of remote sensors carried on groundbased platforms, manned aircraft, satellites, and more recently, unmanned aircraft have been used for precision agriculture applications. Original satellite sensors, such as Landsat and SPOT, have commonly been used for agricultural applications over large geographic areas since the 1970s, but they have limited use for precision agriculture because of their relatively coarse spatial resolution and long revisit time. Recent developments in high resolution satellite sensors have significantly narrowed the gap in spatial resolution between satellite imagery and airborne imagery. Since the first high resolution satellite sensor IKONOS was launched in 1999, numerous commercial high resolution satellite sensors have become available. These imaging sensors not only provide images with high spatial resolution, but can also repeatedly view the same target area. The high revisit frequency and fast data turnaround time, combined with their relatively large aerial coverage, make high resolution satellite sensors attractive for many applications, including precision agriculture. This article will provide an overview of commercially available high resolution satellite sensors that have been used or have potential for precision agriculture. The applications of these sensors for precision agriculture are reviewed and application examples based on the studies conducted by the author and his collaborators are provided to illustrate how high resolution satellite imagery has been used for crop identification, crop yield variability mapping and pest management.

Smart agriculture, as the upgrade of precision agriculture is often called, has developed a strong momentum in terms of research, development, commercialization and adoption. Data acquisition is the first step in implementing precision agriculture and remote sensing can provide an important and convenient method for acquisition of data. Chenghai YANG provides an overview of commercially available high resolution satellite sensors that have been used or have potential for precision agriculture. The applications of these sensors in precision agriculture are reviewed and examples based on the application of the author’s work are provided to illustrate how high resolution satellite imagery has been used for crop identification, crop yield variability mapping and pest management. Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging are other powerful tools for acquisition data in precision agriculture. Yong ZHANG and Naiqian ZHANG review applications of imaging technologies in high-throughput phenotyping, the applications of imaging technologies in detecting and measuring plant morphological, physiological, and pathological traits, and discuss their advantages and limitations. Du-Han KIM et al. describe a real-time onion disease monitoring system using image acquisition that consists of a motorized driving system and a PTZ (pan, tilt and zoom) camera to take images of plants which, after image processing and analysis, can identify the disease areas of onion. Yongjun DING et al. introduce procedures for the extraction of hyperspectral images to detect immature green citrus fruit. After taking the hyperspectral images within citrus trees under natural illumination conditions, the successive projections algorithm (SPA) selects characteristic wavebands and three slope parameters which are used to identify the green citrus fruit. Construction of a detection model according to the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) identifies green fruit by analyzing texture features of separate areas. Results show that the developed algorithm has a great potential for identifying immature green citrus for early yield estimation. Data modelling and interpretion is also an important step in precision agriculture. Yuxin MIAO et al. propose an integrated approach to site-specific management zone delineation. There are three basic approaches to management zone delineation using soil and/or landscape properties, yield information, or both sources of information. Authors suggest an integrated approach to delineate site-specific management zones using relative elevation, organic matter, slope, electrical conductivity, yield spatial trend maps, and yield temporal stability maps. It is concluded that the integrated approach combining soil, landscape and yield spatial-temporal variability information can overcome the weaknesses of approaches using only soil, landscape or yield information, and is more robust for",2018,4,0,10.15302/J-FASE-2018246,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dfe61772e54a913c80993a6528dae1ac115e8076,Review,

715c15ab60fc3adc0567d8f04addd9a4308d6b28,CubeSats Enable High Spatiotemporal Retrievals of Crop-Water Use for Precision Agriculture,"Remote sensing based estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) provides a direct accounting of the crop water use. However, the use of satellite data has generally required that a compromise between spatial and temporal resolution is made, i.e., one could obtain low spatial resolution data regularly, or high spatial resolution occasionally. As a consequence, this spatiotemporal trade-off has tended to limit the impact of remote sensing for precision agricultural applications. With the recent emergence of constellations of small CubeSat-based satellite systems, these constraints are rapidly being removed, such that daily 3 m resolution optical data are now a reality for earth observation. Such advances provide an opportunity to develop new earth system monitoring and assessment tools. In this manuscript we evaluate the capacity of CubeSats to advance the estimation of ET via application of the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) retrieval model. To take advantage of the high-spatiotemporal resolution afforded by these systems, we have integrated a CubeSat derived leaf area index as a forcing variable into PT-JPL, as well as modified key biophysical model parameters. We evaluate model performance over an irrigated farmland in Saudi Arabia using observations from an eddy covariance tower. Crop water use retrievals were also compared against measured irrigation from an in-line flow meter installed within a center-pivot system. To leverage the high spatial resolution of the CubeSat imagery, PT-JPL retrievals were integrated over the source area of the eddy covariance footprint, to allow an equivalent intercomparison. Apart from offering new precision agricultural insights into farm operations and management, the 3 m resolution ET retrievals were shown to explain 86% of the observed variability and provide a relative RMSE of 32.9% for irrigated maize, comparable to previously reported satellite-based retrievals. An observed underestimation was diagnosed as a possible misrepresentation of the local surface moisture status, highlighting the challenge of high-resolution modeling applications for precision agriculture and informing future research directions. .",2018,78,2,10.3390/RS10121867,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/715c15ab60fc3adc0567d8f04addd9a4308d6b28,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

Moraes Department of Animal Sciences, The Ohio State University, 2029 Fyffe Road, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. Modelling growth data and animal responses to nutrient supply often rely on diminishing returns and sigmoidal functions. Estimation of parameters for models that are nonlinear with respect to the parameters, frequently rely on algorithms because closed form solutions are usually not available. Meta-analyses require mixed-effects models that account for both between and within study variances (St-Pierre 2001). The situation becomes particularly challenging with nonlinear mixed-effects models because the marginal likelihood function of the data, obtained by integrating out the random effects from the joint density of the data and random effects, usually does not have a closed form expression (Pinheiro and Bates 2000). Lack of algorithm convergence is common in the animal sciences and nonlinear models that ignore the meta-analytic design are often estimated using nonlinear regression. The objective of this study was to develop a framework to conduct meta-analysis with nonlinear functional forms. A Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach is proposed to introduce between study variability into the parameters of the nonlinear model and represent heterogeneous error variances. Alternative settings for prior distributions and strategies to improve computational efficiency and numerical stability are proposed within our framework, such as constructing the model for the between-study variability using a Cholesky decomposition. An example of the framework is presented with a bi-substrate Michaelis–Menten model developed to predict microbial protein production in the rumen from the supply of rumen-degradable protein, rumendegradable starch, and rumen-degradable fiber.

Balancing essential amino acid fluxes through the post-absorptive tissues in dairy cows A.J. Fleming, H. Lapierre, R. Martineau, and M.D. Hanigan Department of Dairy Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061, USA. Agricultural and Agri-Food Canada, Sherbrooke, QC J1M 0C8, Canada. Essential amino acids (EAA) play a significant role not only in terms of their nutritional availability but also due to their importance in mammary synthesis of milk protein (Bequette and Nelson 2006). To accurately determine mammary EAA supply, one needs to predict utilization by the other post-absorptive tissues. The objective was to evaluate predictions of EAA use by portal-drained viscera (PDV), liver (LIV), mammary (MAM), and the aggregated remaining tissues (OTH). The general equation forms were as follows: FPDVuseðAAÞ = FAbsðAAÞ + FPAðAAÞ − ððFAbsðAAÞ + FPAðAAÞÞ=ðKPDVðAAÞ + BFPAÞÞ × BFPA FLIVuseðAAÞ = FHAðAAÞ + FPVðAAÞ − ððFHAðAAÞ + FPVðAAÞÞ=ðKLIVðAAÞ + BFHVÞÞ × BFHV FMAMuseðAAÞ = FMAðAAÞ − ðFMAðAAÞ=ðKMAMðAAÞ + BFMAÞÞ × BFMA FOTHuseðAAÞ = FAbsðAAÞ − FPDVuseðAAÞ − FLIVuseðAAÞ − FMAMuseðAAÞ where F represents flux; K represents the clearance rate constants; Abs represents absorption; PA, HA, andMA represent portal, hepatic, and mammary arteries, respectively; PV and HV represent portal and hepatic veins, respectively; and BF represents blood flow. Venous fluxes were predicted with high accuracy and precision having concordance correlation coefficients ranging from 0.78 to 0.99 across EAA. Surprisingly, FOTHuse was negative for all EAA except methionine, ranging from 0.01 to −0.27 mol d suggesting that AA balance was negative for most treatments. Resolution of the problem will allow derivation of use parameters for OTH and subsequently predictions of arterial concentrations using only FAbs as an input.

Understanding mechanisms and quantitative description of cellular responses to changing nutrient supply are critical for predicting milk component yields. Our objective was to evaluate cellular uptake and kinetic behavior of varied extracellular concentrations of individual amino acids (AA) simultaneously. Bovine mammary epithelial cells were the subjects. Treatments were four AA concentrations, 0.36, 2.30, 4.28, and 6.24 mmol L. Twenty-four plates of cells (100 mm × 20 mm) were assigned to each treatment. Cells were first subjected to treatment media enriched with N labelled AA for 24 h and then incubated with treatment media enriched with C labelled AA for 0, 15, 60, 300, 900, 1800, and 3600 s. Intracellular free AA, intracellular protein-bound AA, and extracellular media AA were analyzed for concentrations and isotopic enrichment. A dynamic 9-pool model was constructed representing extracellular, intracellular, and turnover pools for individual AA and respective isotopes. Fluxes were extracellular to intracellular, intracellular efflux, protein turnover, transamination, oxidation, and synthesis. As an example, cellular influx and efflux ranged from 0.9 to 11.1 and 0 to 9.5 nmol min for leucine (Leu), whereas alanine (Ala) ranged from 1.6 to 50.0 and 0.9 to 56.9 nmol min for influx and efflux. The average root mean square prediction error for the nine pools was 14.6% and 10.6% for Leu and Ala, respectively. When AA influx was standardized to total pool of the respective AA, Michaelis–Menten kinetics were observed with a Km of 72 and 345 μmol for Leu and Ala, respectively. The described model provides insight on individual AA transport kinetics. Comparison of nonlinear models to estimate N partitioning kinetics into milk, urine, and feces of lactating dairy cows from individually labeled feed ingredients K.F. Reed, T. Barros, J.M.

Deptartment of Dairy Science, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA. The objective was to estimate the fractional rate of excretion (k) and maximum enrichment (A) of feed N in excreta and milk. Corn silage, alfalfa silage, corn grain, and soybean meal (SBM) enriched with N were fed in four diets to 12 cows for 4 d as described by Powell et al. (2017). Cows were fed once andmilked twice daily; total collection of urine and faeces occurred at 6 h intervals during the 4 d enrichment and 4 d decay period. Samples were analyzed for N atom percent excess. The following four models were compared: (1) exponential enrichment model, (2) exponential decay model, (3) piece-wise, complete data exponential model, and (4) logistic enrichment model. Models were fitted with the nlme package in R statistical software, and differences between diets were tested using the multcomp package (H0: θi= θi’ vs. H1: θi ≠ θi’, where θi = Ai or ki). All models except model 2 resulted in the same estimates of dietary order and significant differences for A (P≤ 0.1). All models estimated faecal N k was greater for silages than grains. Models 1 and 4 had similar estimates of urinary N k; models 2 and 3 had no significant differences. Milk N enrichment k estimates varied greatly: models 1 and 4 indicated SBM has the fastest enrichment, and model 3 estimated SBM has the slowest decay rate. Also, variation in k between enrichment and decay for milk and urine N, but not faecal N, and a slow turnover metabolic pool are aspects requiring further investigation.

Sedentary species with specific habitat requirements are assumed to occur more patchy than mobile habitat generalist species, and thus suffer stronger under habitat fragmentation and habitat deterioration. In this study we measured dispersal and habitat preference of three selected butterfly species using mark-release-recapture technique. We used data on species abundance to calculate Species Distribution Models based on high-resolution aerial photographs taken using RGB / NIR cameras mounted on a UAV. We found that microhabitats for species with specific habitat requirements occur spatially restricted. In contrast, suitable habitats are more interconnected and widespread for mobile habitat generalists. Our models indicate that even managed grassland sites have comparatively little habitat quality, while road verges provide high quality micro-habitats. In addition, dispersal was more restricted for specialist butterfly species, and higher for the two other butterfly species with less ecological specialisation. This study shows synergies arising when combining ecological data with high precision aerial pictures and Species Distribution Models, to identify micro-habitats for butterflies. This approach might be suitable to identify and conserve high quality habitats, and to improve nature conservation at the ground.",2018,14,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0207052,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/90caa9b09274460c5b1867314f31b2bc383f48a3,JournalArticle,PLoS ONE

Although a comprehensive control program is in place and on-farm mitigation strategies to curtail bTB transmission between cattle and deer have been implemented for over a decade, cattle and deer continue to become infected with the disease. Thus, renewed motivation to eradicate bTB is needed if that is truly the goal. Recurrent detection of bTB in cattle in the region is of mounting concern for state and federal agricultural agencies, producers, and wildlife managers. Current on-farm mitigation efforts include fencing and refined cattle feeding and watering practices. Liberal removal of antlerless deer through hunter harvest and disease control permits (DCPs) issued to cattle producers and agency sharp shooters have also been ongoing. Although these strategies have merit and efforts to reduce prevalence in deer and occurrence of positive farms are elevated, additional actions are needed. Heightened management actions to combat bTB in deer could include deer vaccination programs, strategic habitat manipulations to redistribute deer from farms, and precision removal of deer in proximity to high-risk farms. Foundational research to address development and delivery of vaccine to free-ranging deer is complete. Strategic management and habitat manipulation could reduce and disperse local concentrations of deer while better meeting wildlife, forestry, and agricultural goals. The responses of local deer populations to targeted removal of individuals are generally understood and there is potential to reduce deer activity around agricultural operations while allowing them to persist nearby on natural foods. We summarize the history and progress to date, discuss the realized merit of novel management strategies, and suggest options to rid deer and cattle in Michigan of bTB.",2018,51,2,10.3389/fvets.2018.00301,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c790e5a29c069766dc9e81b603649788abb8d383,"Review,JournalArticle",Frontiers in Veterinary Science
25d3858594267cf05519dc06460ba8a6fc1dda10,Depth Estimation Based on Pyramid Normalized Cross-Correlation Algorithm for Vergence Control,"A depth estimation algorithm based on vergence vision using a mechanical joint attached to two cameras is proposed. A Gaussian pyramid template-matching approach is used to align the view of the slave camera to the fixation point of the master camera. The master camera uses an object detection algorithm to find the target’s centroid and centers it relative to the image coordinates. Then, the vergence movement of the slave camera is performed using a pyramid normalized cross-correlation algorithm. Simple geometric triangulation is employed to compute the depth of that target. This proposed method was implemented using an active binocular vision platform with five degrees of freedom where four degrees of freedom to control the pan and tilt independently, and one degree of freedom to control the baseline, which is the distance between the camera. This system was designed for implementation in agriculture harvesting applications.

Hence, the importance of 3-PBA evaluation after pyrethroid application. There is a gap of analytical methods to determine 3-PBA in soil samples. Therefore, an analytical method that combines the solid-phase extraction (SPE) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) detection has been developed for the determination of 3-PBA in soil samples. The analytical method was validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, intra- and inter-day batch precisions, recoveries, and quantification limits. An SPE method using a Strata X cartridge allows obtaining limits of detection and quantification equal to 4.0 and 13.3 ng g−1, respectively. Under optimized conditions, the method average recovery levels ranged from 70.3 to 93.5% with a relative standard deviation below 3.4%. Method intra- and inter-day precision was under 5.0 and 4.8%, respectively. The developed method was applied to 11 agricultural soil samples in the north of Portugal. The developed methodology allowed for the determination of the pyrethroid metabolite, 3-PBA, in agricultural soil samples at levels of few ng g−1.

In this paper, a 28.5 hm2 winter wheat field under the traditional cultivation model in Tianzhuang town of Huantai County was selected as the research area. The mesh point method was utilized for sampling (60×60 m), and the characteristics of soil available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) variations in the before sowing, reviving, jointing, and filling stages of winter wheat were analyzed using geostatistical and GIS methods. Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis was used to study the response of wheat growth and development to soil nutrient variations. As the growth stages progressed, 1) each nutrient showed the characteristics of low-high-low and moderate variability. The highest AN and AK contents were found at the reviving stage, while AP reached a turning point at the jointing stage. The order of variability of each nutrient was AN>AP>AK. 2) The nutrient variations first increased and then decreased and showed medium to strong spatial correlation. The three nutrients were strongly spatially correlated in the before sowing stage and moderately spatially correlated during the reviving stage. During the jointing and filling stages, AN had moderate spatial correlation, and AP and AK had strong spatial correlation. The spatial correlation of each nutrient was the weakest in the reviving stage, and the spatial correlation of AN was strongest in the before sowing stage, while the spatial correlations of AP and AK were strongest in the jointing stage. The spatial correlation of each soil nutrient decreased from the before sowing stage to the reviving stage and from the jointing stage to the filling stage, and the spatial correlation increased from the reviving stage to the jointing stage. 3) The soil nutrient content first increased and then decreased, and the grades of the nutrients gradually decreased. 4) The correlation between soil nutrients and wheat growth gradually increased. AN had the highest correlation with wheat growth, followed by AK and AP. The effect of soil nutrients on the growth of wheat at the reviving stage was greater than the effect of nutrients in the current stage. The growth of wheat at the jointing stage was mainly influenced by nutrients in the current stage, while the growth of wheat at the filling stage was influenced by the nutrient contents of both the previous and current stages. Thus, the date of fertilizer supplementation should be postponed properly. In this study, the soil nutrient dynamics and their influence on the growth of wheat during the winter wheat growth period under the traditional field model were well described, and these results could provide a theoretical basis for the precision management of soil nutrients in the northern winter wheat area where the planting environment and cultivation management are relatively uniform.",2018,21,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0203509,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/24757ca99b8805eaf7525412ae727a004a914c8c,JournalArticle,PLoS ONE

1f0015f039167954c67114a0e909879d7a11d923,Impacts of the EU GMO regulatory framework for plant genome editing,"Abstract New plant breeding technologies, such as genome editing, are enabling new crop varieties to be developed far quicker and with greater precision and scope than achievable using conventional methods. These advances could help farmers address the challenges of climate change, sustainability, and global food security. However, despite their potential, the uptake of these new technologies has been slowed down due to the uncertainty associated with the regulation of genome edited crops. For many European consumers, their view of new breeding technologies is influenced by many factors. Those who have never faced a major food crisis may not sufficiently appreciate the challenges posed by a projected rise of 2 billion in the human population by 2050. In addition, consumers with a regular and plentiful supply of food may not have to consider how their food is produced, or appreciate the challenges EU farmers are already facing to meet future demand. Misleading online articles, questioning the safety and ethics of these “new” biotech foods, can also lead consumers to be reluctant to accept them. Consequently, Europe's mixed view on biotech crops may also be hindering their adoption in countries who have even more to gain from the technology. In this review, we discuss the current data on global and EU GM crop adoption and the potential impact a new wave of crop development may have for agriculture. We reflect on how the EU has viewed GM crops, and we consider the future of both genetic modification (GM) and genome editing (GE) in the EU. We explore lessons learnt from the adoption of GM crops and examine the potential impact the recent decision not to exempt genome edited crops from the EU GMO Directive, will have on EU farmers, scientists, consumers, trading countries, and the rest of the world.",2018,48,4,10.1002/fes3.161,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f0015f039167954c67114a0e909879d7a11d923,"Review,JournalArticle",Food and Energy Security

In LIDAR (light detection and ranging) applications, single-photon sensitive detection is an emerging approach, offering high sensitivity to light and picosecond temporal resolution, and consequently excellent surface-to-surface resolution. The use of large format CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) single-photon detector arrays provides high spatial resolution and allows the timing information to be acquired simultaneously across many pixels. In this work, we combine state-of-the-art single-photon detector array technology with non-local data fusion to generate high resolution three-dimensional depth information of long-range targets.

6dc063795678326e50b954b4a06d7f266b517d38,Intra-Season Crop Height Variability at Commercial Farm Scales Using a Fixed-Wing UAV,"Monitoring the development of vegetation height through time provides a key indicator of crop health and overall condition. Traditional manual approaches for monitoring crop height are generally time consuming, labor intensive and impractical for large-scale operations. Dynamic crop heights collected through the season allow for the identification of within-field problems at critical stages of the growth cycle, providing a mechanism for remedial action to be taken against end of season yield losses. With advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies, routine monitoring of height is now feasible at any time throughout the growth cycle. To demonstrate this capability, five digital surface maps (DSM) were reconstructed from high-resolution RGB imagery collected over a field of maize during the course of a single growing season. The UAV retrievals were compared against LiDAR scans for the purpose of evaluating the derived point clouds capacity to capture ground surface variability and spatially variable crop height. A strong correlation was observed between structure-from-motion (SfM) derived heights and pixel-to-pixel comparison against LiDAR scan data for the intra-season bare-ground surface (R2 = 0.77 − 0.99, rRMSE = 0.44% − 0.85%), while there was reasonable agreement between canopy comparisons (R2 = 0.57 − 0.65, rRMSE = 37% − 50%). To examine the effect of resolution on retrieval accuracy and processing time, an evaluation of several ground sampling distances (GSD) was also performed. Our results indicate that a 10 cm resolution retrieval delivers a reliable product that provides a compromise between computational cost and spatial fidelity. Overall, UAV retrievals were able to accurately reproduce the observed spatial variability of crop heights within the maize field through the growing season and provide a valuable source of information with which to inform precision agricultural management in an operational context.",2018,77,1,10.3390/rs10122007,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6dc063795678326e50b954b4a06d7f266b517d38,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

Although numerous methods have been proposed to monitor crop nitrogen (N) status in recent decades, just how to utilize an appropriate modeling algorithm to estimate crop leaf N content (LNC) remains poorly understood, especially based on UAV multispectral imagery. A comparative assessment of different modeling algorithms (i.e., simple and non-parametric modeling algorithms alongside the physical model retrieval method) for winter wheat LNC estimation is presented in this study. Experiments were conducted over two consecutive years and involved different winter wheat varieties, N rates, and planting densities. A five-band multispectral camera (i.e., 490 nm, 550 nm, 671 nm, 700 nm, and 800 nm) was mounted on a UAV to acquire canopy images across five critical growth stages. The results of this study showed that the best-performing vegetation index (VI) was the modified renormalized difference VI (RDVI), which had a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.73 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.38. This method was also characterized by a high processing speed (0.03 s) for model calibration and validation. Among the 13 non-parametric modeling algorithms evaluated here, the random forest (RF) approach performed best, characterized by R2 and RMSE values of 0.79 and 0.33, respectively. This method also had the advantage of full optical spectrum utilization and enabled flexible, non-linear fitting with a fast processing speed (2.3 s). Compared to the other two methods assessed here, the use of a look up table (LUT)-based radiative transfer model (RTM) remained challenging with regard to LNC estimation because of low prediction accuracy (i.e., an R2 value of 0.62 and an RMSE value of 0.46) and slow processing speed. The RF approach is a fast and accurate technique for N estimation based on UAV multispectral imagery.",2018,97,6,10.3390/RS10122026,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03c09252250eceb21a315649646c5d86a2207127,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing
abdec0b45dcd5cf594258ea5a9d87adfdfb1a677,Geometrical Stem Detection from Image Data for Precision Agriculture,"High efficiency in precision farming depends on accurate tools to perform weed detection and mapping of crops. This allows for precise removal of harmful weeds with a lower amount of pesticides, as well as increase of the harvest's yield by providing the farmer with valuable information. In this paper, we address the problem of fully automatic stem detection from image data for this purpose. Our approach runs on mobile agricultural robots taking RGB images. After processing the images to obtain a vegetation mask, our approach separates each plant into its individual leaves and later estimates a precise stem position. This allows an upstream mapping algorithm to add the high-resolution stem positions as a semantic aggregate to the global map of the robot, which can be used for weeding and for analyzing crop statistics. We implemented our approach and thoroughly tested it on three different datasets with vegetation masks and stem position ground truth. The experiments presented in this paper conclude that our module is able to detect leaves and estimate the stem's position at a rate of 56 Hz on a single CPU. We furthermore provide the software to the community.",2018,1,0,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/abdec0b45dcd5cf594258ea5a9d87adfdfb1a677,JournalArticle,arXiv.org

The scale of data generated requires automated methods to extract plant traits of importance from the image data. However, the variations in the imaging, lighting and environmental conditions make this a challenging task. In this work, we provide an image analysis pipeline developed on field-based image data of maize. The pipeline broadly consists of three sequential steps: automated tassel detection using Faster Region based Convolutional Neural Network, pixel level localization of the tassel structure using color information and adaptive thresholding, and tassel length computation for straight as well as curved tassels by combining piecewise Hough lines.

Farming techniques have drastically evolved over the last few decades to keep up with the ever-growing demand for food. Among its various applications, the use of drones in farming, called agricultural drones, can help in increasing the yied of crop and to monitor its growth. This type of drone is termed as agricultural drone. These drones can be used to spray fertilizers or pesticides uniformly across the field. Also, the aerial mapping feature will give the farmers a bird eye view of their fields and help them quickly identify presence of pests, crop damages and soil conditions. Hence, our main was to build a market ready agricultural drone and not just a prototype – a drone which is affordable, user friendly, portable and can perform autonomous flight without the use of an operator.

The lack of very efficient preventive (best results using commercial products report 20% efficiency) and curative means induces huge economic losses. The study presented in this paper is centered around the in-field detection of foliar esca symptoms during summer, exhibiting a typical “striped” pattern. Indeed, in-field disease detection has shown great potential for commercial applications and has been successfully used for other agricultural needs such as yield estimation. Differentiation with foliar symptoms caused by other diseases or abiotic stresses was also considered. Two vineyards from the Bordeaux region (France, Aquitaine) were chosen as the basis for the experiment. Pictures of diseased and healthy vine plants were acquired during summer 2017 and labeled at the leaf scale, resulting in a patch database of around 6000 images (224 × 224 pixels) divided into red cultivar and white cultivar samples. Then, we tackled the classification part of the problem comparing state-of-the-art SIFT encoding and pre-trained deep learning feature extractors for the classification of database patches. In the best case, 91% overall accuracy was obtained using deep features extracted from MobileNet network trained on ImageNet database, demonstrating the efficiency of simple transfer learning approaches without the need to design an ad-hoc specific feature extractor. The third part aimed at disease detection (using bounding boxes) within full plant images. For this purpose, we integrated the deep learning base network within a “one-step” detection network (RetinaNet), allowing us to perform detection queries in real time (approximately six frames per second on GPU). Recall/Precision (RP) and Average Precision (AP) metrics then allowed us to evaluate the performance of the network on a 91-image (plants) validation database. Overall, 90% precision for a 40% recall was obtained while best esca AP was about 70%. Good correlation between annotated and detected symptomatic surface per plant was also obtained, meaning slightly symptomatic plants can be efficiently separated from severely attacked plants.",2018,81,2,10.3390/RS11010001,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd818ad6796648707fcf0e4870916260ca5e5e23,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

c228dc9c9a4e82016afa802992c4c65fdc3fc1d0,"Quantitatively estimating main soil water-soluble salt ions content based on Visible-near infrared wavelength selected using GC, SR and VIP","Soil salinization is the primary obstacle to the sustainable development of agriculture and eco-environment in arid regions. The accurate inversion of the major water-soluble salt ions in the soil using visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy technique can enhance the effectiveness of saline soil management. However, the accuracy of spectral models of soil salt ions turns out to be affected by high dimensionality and noise information of spectral data. This study aims to improve the model accuracy by optimizing the spectral models based on the exploration of the sensitive spectral intervals of different salt ions. To this end, 120 soil samples were collected from Shahaoqu Irrigation Area in Inner Mongolia, China. After determining the raw reflectance spectrum and content of salt ions in the lab, the spectral data were pre-treated by standard normal variable (SNV). Subsequently the sensitive spectral intervals of each ion were selected using methods of gray correlation (GC), stepwise regression (SR) and variable importance in projection (VIP). Finally, the performance of both models of partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector regression (SVR) was investigated on the basis of the sensitive spectral intervals. The results indicated that the model accuracy based on the sensitive spectral intervals selected using different analytical methods turned out to be different: VIP was the highest, SR came next and GC was the lowest. The optimal inversion models of different ions were different. In general, both PLSR and SVR had achieved satisfactory model accuracy, but PLSR outperformed SVR in the forecasting effects. Great difference existed among the optimal inversion accuracy of different ions: the predicative accuracy of Ca2+, Na+, Cl−, Mg2+ and SO42− was very high, that of CO32− was high and K+ was relatively lower, but HCO3− failed to have any predicative power. These findings provide a new approach for the optimization of the spectral model of water-soluble salt ions and improvement of its predicative precision.",2018,21,0,10.7717/peerj.6310,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c228dc9c9a4e82016afa802992c4c65fdc3fc1d0,JournalArticle,PeerJ

000f4079fb3f5463ce7f5e566b541fec68a91f02,The combine will tell the truth: On precision agriculture and algorithmic rationality,"Recent technological and methodological changes in farming have led to an emerging set of claims about the role of digital technology in food production. Known as precision agriculture, the integration of digital management and surveillance technologies in farming is normatively presented as a revolutionary transformation. Proponents contend that machine learning, Big Data, and automation will create more accurate, efficient, transparent, and environmentally friendly food production, staving off both food insecurity and ecological ruin. This article contributes a critique of these rhetorical and discursive claims to a growing body of critical literature on precision agriculture. It argues precision agriculture is less a revolution than an evolution, an effort to shore up and intensify the conventional farming system responsible for generating many of the social and environmental problems precision agriculture is presented as solving. While precision agriculture advocates portray it as a radical, even democratic epistemological break with the past, this paper locates truth claims surrounding datafication and algorithmic control in farming within deeper historical contexts of the capitalist rationalization of production and efforts to quantify and automate physical and mental labor. Abjuring the growing cultural tendency to treat algorithmic systems as revolutionary in favor of social and historical dimensions of precision agriculture, can help re-frame the discussion about its design and use around real, socially and ecologically oriented change in farming, and so ensure that the possibilities and benefits of precision agriculture are as evenly and effectively shared as possible.",2019,130,11,10.1177/2053951719849444,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f4079fb3f5463ce7f5e566b541fec68a91f02,JournalArticle,Big Data & Society

The emergence of pedometrics as a distinct subdiscipline of soil science was a gradual 3 process, and had its roots in earlier studies than this one, but if one publication is to mark the 4 start of pedometrics, then this is it. 5 The publication of this paper, and the successors in the series that it initiated, showed that 6 statistics could do more than just assist the soil surveyor in quantitative prediction from maps 7 based on a legend of discrete units. It showed soil scientists that there was a very different way 8 of mapping the soil, namely through geostatistical interpolation. 9 The impact of the paper on practice has been substantial. Soil scientists have used geosta10 tistical prediction to map the distribution of nutrients or pests at within-field scale for precision 11 agriculture, to delineate contaminated land, to map changes in soil properties over time at the 12 regional scale to map the risk of problems such as salinity and even for forensic inference. 13 The value of geostatistics was soon recognized in soil science. This is, in part, because when 14 one considers the state of the art at the time of its publication it is clear that it fulfilled a need for 15 new methods. At the same time, its impact was not simply due to the method it introduced to 16 soil science, ordinary kriging, but to the interest it stimulated among soil scientists and applied 17 statisticians who went on to develop and improve the methodology in several critical ways. 18",2019,2,0,10.1111/ejss.12750,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/525e620701f43819949d4a0b6af3da80ad8aae58,Review,European Journal of Soil Science

Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop a machine learning system that has the advantages of high computational speed and good accuracy for recognizing spray and non-spray areas for UAV-based sprayers. A machine learning system was developed by using the mutual subspace method (MSM) for images collected from a UAV. Two target lands: agricultural croplands and orchard areas, were considered in building two classifiers for distinguishing spray and non-spray areas. The field experiments were conducted in target areas to train and test the system by using a commercial UAV (DJI Phantom 3 Pro) with an onboard 4K camera. The images were collected from low (5 m) and high (15 m) altitudes for croplands and orchards, respectively. The recognition system was divided into offline and online systems. In the offline recognition system, 74.4% accuracy was obtained for the classifiers in recognizing spray and non-spray areas for croplands. In the case of orchards, the average classifier recognition accuracy of spray and non-spray areas was 77%. On the other hand, the online recognition system performance had an average accuracy of 65.1% for croplands, and 75.1% for orchards. The computational time for the online recognition system was minimal, with an average of 0.0031 s for classifier recognition. The developed machine learning system had an average recognition accuracy of 70%, which can be implemented in an autonomous UAV spray system for recognizing spray and non-spray areas for real-time applications.",2019,34,2,10.3390/s19020313,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/78779eddb621a4de03ac8f0a6734237677cdb185,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

Thanks to a decrease in price of video camera devices and the diffusion of cheap small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), video monitoring is today adopted in a wide range of application cases, from road traffic control to precision agriculture. This leads to capture a great amount of visual material to be monitored and screened for event detection. However, information that is gathered from a platform of video monitoring UAVs may produce high-volume data, whose processing is unfeasible to be done locally by the same UAVs that perform monitoring. Moreover, because of the limited bandwidth of wireless links connecting UAVs to computing infrastructures that are installed on ground, offloading these data to edge clouds renders these platforms infeasible for video analysis applications with low-latency requirements. The target of this paper is to extend a 5G network slice for video monitoring with a Flying Ad-hoc NETwork (FANET) constituted by UAVs with multi-access edge computing (MEC) facilities (MEC UAVs), flying very close to the layer of UAVs monitoring the area of interest. A policy for mutual help among MEC UAVS is defined in order to increase the performance of the whole aerial MEC platform, so further reducing end-to-end latency between sources and actuators, and increasing system reliability.

Unlike conventional agriculture, sugarcane farms are usually regions with dense vegetation, gigantic areas, and subjected to extreme weather conditions, such as intense heat, moisture and rain. TIBA - Tankette for Intelligent BioEnergy Agriculture - is the first result of an R&D project which strives to develop an autonomous mobile robotic system for carrying out a number of agricultural tasks in sugarcane fields. The proposed concept consists of a semi-autonomous, low-cost, dust and waterproof tankette-type vehicle, capable of infiltrating dense vegetation in plantation tunnels and carry several sensing systems, in order to perform mapping of hard-to-access areas and collecting samples. This paper presents an overview of the robot mechanical design, the embedded electronics and software architecture, and the construction of a first prototype. Preliminary results obtained in field tests validate the proposed conceptual design and bring about several challenges and potential applications for robot autonomous navigation, as well as to build a new prototype with additional functionality.",2019,6,0,10.20906/CPS/CBA2018-1357,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/62e3fe6d6e594cb33d74250b3d830541e4eee839,"JournalArticle,Review",arXiv.org

The primary motive of the ACPS is to perform real-time fault location tracking in the agricultural field using multivariate sensor data. The computing model in the ACPS uses a novel hybrid classification approach which combines two classifiers for the location estimation of the sensor node. The novelty of the proposed method lies in predicting the locations that need more irrigation, soil nutrients or immediate human intervention using the sensor data. We also derive the computational complexity of the proposed method. The location accuracy improves reasonably as compared to the current-state-of-the-art methods.",2019,8,0,10.1145/3288599.3288621,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01b3ec2ae24e72bfc4abfef5749155a97d156aa6,"Book,JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference of Distributed Computing and Networking
5f9491747eca33eb0a59f00d536a65b378d27a7c,"Plant Phenotyping Research Trends, a Science Mapping Approach","Modern plant phenotyping, often using non-invasive technologies and digital technologies, is an emerging science and provides essential information on how genetics, epigenetics, environmental pressures, and crop management (farming) can guide selection toward productive plants suitable for their environment. Thus, phenotyping is at the forefront of future plant breeding. Bibliometric science mapping is a quantitative method that analyzes scientific publications throughout the terms present in their title, abstract, and keywords. The aim of this mapping exercise is to observe trends and identify research opportunities. This allows us to analyze the evolution of phenotyping research and to predict emerging topics of this discipline. A total of 1,827 scientific publications fitted our search method over the last 20 years. During the period 1997–2006, the total number of publications was only around 6.1%. The number of publications increased more steeply after 2010, boosted by the overcoming of technological bias and by a set of key developments at hard and software level (image analysis and data storage management, automation and robotics). Cluster analysis evidenced three main groups linked to genetics, physiology, and imaging. Mainly the model plant “Arabidopsis thaliana” and the crops “rice” and “triticum” species were investigated in the literature. The last two species were studied when addressing “plant breeding,” and “genomic selection.” However, currently the trend goes toward a higher diversity of phenotyped crops and research in the field. The application of plant phenotyping in the field is still under rapid development and this application has strong linkages with precision agriculture. EU co-authors were involved in 41.8% of the analyzed papers, followed by USA (15.4%), Australia (6.0%), and India (5.6%). Within the EU, coauthors were mainly affiliated in Germany (35.8%), France (23.7%), and United Kingdom (18.4%). Time seems right for new opportunities to incentivize research on more crops, in real field conditions, and to spread knowledge toward more countries, including emerging economies. Science mapping offers the possibility to get insights into a wide amount of bibliographic information, making them more manageable, attractive, and easy to serve science policy makers, stakeholders, and research managers.",2019,138,2,10.3389/fpls.2018.01933,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f9491747eca33eb0a59f00d536a65b378d27a7c,JournalArticle,Frontiers in Plant Science

5b24ae57056546ce31b648bb45daea81cea1844a,Transforming insect population control with precision guided sterile males with demonstration in flies,"The sterile insect technique (SIT) is an environmentally safe and proven technology to suppress wild populations. To further advance its utility, a novel CRISPR-based technology termed precision guided SIT (pgSIT) is described. PgSIT mechanistically relies on a dominant genetic technology that enables simultaneous sexing and sterilization, facilitating the release of eggs into the environment ensuring only sterile adult males emerge. Importantly, for field applications, the release of eggs will eliminate burdens of manually sexing and sterilizing males, thereby reducing overall effort and increasing scalability. Here, to demonstrate efficacy, we systematically engineer multiple pgSIT systems in Drosophila which consistently give rise to 100% sterile males. Importantly, we demonstrate that pgSIT-generated sterile males are fit and competitive. Using mathematical models, we predict pgSIT will induce substantially greater population suppression than can be achieved by currently-available self-limiting suppression technologies. Taken together, pgSIT offers to potentially transform our ability to control insect agricultural pests and disease vectors.Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is used to suppress wild populations. Here the authors integrate CRISPR-based technology and SIT to develop a precision guided SIT (pgSIT), and demonstrate its proof-of-principle by generating 100% sterile males.",2019,204,1,10.1038/s41467-018-07964-7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b24ae57056546ce31b648bb45daea81cea1844a,"JournalArticle,Study",Nature Communications

Therefore, the use of precision agriculture becomes more evident. When it comes to making decisions on crops, it is evident the need to apply the concept of Smart Agriculture, that focuses on utilizing different sensors and actuators. As the number of IoT devices used in agriculture grows exponentially, it is necessary to design the implemented network so that the data is transmitted without problems. The present work shows a wireless network design, in which we use the information collected by the sensors of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), and a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) formed by Access Points (AP) to transmit the data to a network that monitors agriculture for smart irrigation. In addition, through simulations we have presented a proposal of the maximum number of nodes that must be connected to an AP so that the network is efficient.",2019,8,0,10.5296/npa.v10i4.14147,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad0578f8a9c5a06d1780fb1d1f673174f7f6409b,JournalArticle,Netw.

In many cases of environmental measurement in the greenhouse, a fixed sensor can measure near the installation location. However, to estimate the distribution of the environmental information in the whole greenhouse, it is necessary to install many sensors, which increases the cost. Therefore, in this study, to acquire more the detailed environmental information, we propose the system to measure the environmental information in the greenhouse by the mobile robot using ROS.

00e65f396b4febdc799e03c997608fbeb1035905,Achlys: Towards a Framework for Distributed Storage and Generic Computing Applications for Wireless IoT Edge Networks with Lasp on GRiSP,"Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow exponentially, in number of devices and the amount of data they generate. Processing this data requires an exponential increase in computing power. For example, aggregation can be done directly at the edge. However, aggregation is very limited; ideally we would like to do more general computations at the edge. In this paper we propose a framework for doing general-purpose edge computing directly on sensor networks themselves, without requiring external connections to gateways or cloud. This is challenging because sensor networks have unreliable communication, unreliable nodes, and limited (if any) computing power and storage. How can we implement production-quality components directly on these networks? We need to bridge the gap between the unreliable, limited infrastructure and the stringent requirements of the components. To solve this problem we present Achlys, an edge computing framework that provides reliable storage, computation, and communication capabilities directly on wireless networks of IoT sensor nodes. Using Achlys, the sensor network is able to configure and manage itself directly, without external connectivity. Achlys combines the Lasp key/value store and the Partisan communication library. Lasp provides efficient decentralized storage based on the properties of CRDTs (Conftict-Free Replicated Data Types). Partisan provides efficient connectivity and broadcast based on hybrid gossip. Both Lasp and Partisan are specifically designed to be extremely resilient. They are able to continue working despite high node churn, frequent network partitions, and unreliable communication. Our first implementation of Achlys is on a network of GRiSP embedded system boards. We choose GRiSP as our first implementation platform because it implements high-level functionality, namely Erlang, directly on the bare hardware and because it directly supports Pmod sensors and wireless connectivity. We give some first results on using Achlys for building edge systems and we explain how we plan to evolve Achlys in the future. Achlys is a work in progress that is being done in the context of the LightKone European H2020 research project, and we are in the process of implementing and evaluating a proof-of-concept application in the area of precision agriculture.",2019,6,0,10.1109/PERCOMW.2019.8730773,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00e65f396b4febdc799e03c997608fbeb1035905,"JournalArticle,Conference",2019 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops)
4c30f895b856450e96842128a8fd3455e7d94332,Irrigation of Greenhouse Crops,"Precision agricultural greenhouse systems indicate considerable scope for improvement of irrigation management practices, since growers typically irrigate crops based on their personal experience. Soil-based greenhouse crop irrigation management requires estimation on a daily basis, whereas soilless systems must be estimated on an hourly or even shorter interval schedule. Historically, irrigation scheduling methods have been based on soil or substrate monitoring, dependent on climate or time with each having both strengths and weaknesses. Recently, plant-based monitoring or plant reflectance-derived indices have been developed, yet their potential is limited for estimating the irrigation rate in order to apply proper irrigation scheduling. Optimization of irrigation practices imposes different irrigation approaches, based on prevailing greenhouse environments, considering plant-water-soil relationships. This article presents a comprehensive review of the literature, which deals with irrigation scheduling approaches applied for soil and soilless greenhouse production systems. Irrigation decisions are categorized according to whether or not an automatic irrigation control has the ability to support a feedback irrigation decision system.

The study of the monitoring and/or estimation of areas using vegetation indices derived from multitemporal data from MODIS sensors is being studied in the search for greater objectivity of the generated values. In this context, the objective of this study was to map areas with winter and second-crop corn using EVI/MODIS time series from the Terra and Aqua satellites, for the seasons from 2012 to 2014 in the Paraná state of Brazil. Accuracy analysis of the mappings was performed in spatial resolution images of 30 m (LISS-III and Landsat-8), to identify and validate the masks the crops of interest.

The Piccolo dual field-of-view system collects up- and downwelling radiation nearly simultaneously with one spectrometer. Such systems offer great promise for crop monitoring under highly variable atmospheric conditions.

We propose an LAI retrieval approach based on a combination of the LAINet observation system, the Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations (CACAO) method, and Gaussian process regression (GPR). First, the LAINet wireless sensor network provides temporally continuous field measurements of LAI. Then, the CACAO approach generates synchronous reflectance data at high spatiotemporal resolution (30-m and 8-day) from the fusion of multitemporal MODIS and high spatial resolution Landsat satellite imagery. Finally, the GPR machine learning regression algorithm retrieves the LAI maps and their associated uncertainties. A case study in a cropland site in China showed that the accuracy of LAI retrievals is 0.36 (12.7%) in terms of root mean square error and R2 = 0.88 correlation with ground measurements as evaluated over the entire growing season. This paper demonstrates the potential of the joint use of newly developed software and hardware technologies in deriving concomitant LAI and uncertainty maps with high spatiotemporal resolution.

37cfaa1d2854444df0830c08e16f68c00015d705,Simplified Evaluation of Cotton Water Stress Using High Resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Thermal Imagery,"Irrigation water management and real-time monitoring of crop water stress status can enhance agricultural water use efficiency, crop yield, and crop quality. The aim of this study was to simplify the calculation of the crop water stress index (CWSI) and improve its diagnostic accuracy. Simplified CWSI (CWSIsi) was used to diagnose water stress for cotton that has received four different irrigation treatments (no stress, mild stress, moderate stress, and severe stress) at the flowering and boll stage. High resolution thermal infrared and multispectral images were taken using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle remote sensing platform at midday (local time 13:00), and stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration rate (tr), and cotton root zone soil volumetric water content (θ) were concurrently measured. The soil background pixels of thermal images were eliminated using the Canny edge detection to obtain a unimodal histogram of pure canopy temperatures. Then the wet reference temperature (Twet), dry reference temperature (Tdry), and mean canopy temperature (Tl) were obtained from the canopy temperature histogram to calculate CWSIsi. The other two methods of CWSI evaluation were empirical CWSI (CWSIe), in which the temperature parameters were determined by measuring natural reference cotton leaves, and statistical CWSI (CWSIs), in which Twet was the mean of the lowest 5% of canopy temperatures and Tdry was the air temperature (Tair) + 5 °C. Compared with CWSIe, CWSIs and spectral indices (NDVI, TCARI, OSAVI, TCARI/OSAVI), CWSIsi has higher correlation with gs (R2 = 0.660) and tr (R2 = 0.592). The correlation coefficient (R) for θ (0–45 cm) and CWSIsi is also high (0.812).

162b64c49ed1460505b0e472d863ba9db2dce535,How many to sample? Statistical guidelines for monitoring animal welfare outcomes,"There is increasing scrutiny of the animal welfare impacts of all animal use activities, including agriculture, the keeping of companion animals, racing and entertainment, research and laboratory use, and wildlife management programs. A common objective of animal welfare monitoring is to quantify the frequency of adverse animal events (e.g., injuries or mortalities). The frequency of such events can be used to provide pass/fail grades for animal use activities relative to a defined threshold and to identify areas for improvement through research. A critical question in these situations is how many animals should be sampled? There are, however, few guidelines available for data collection or analysis, and consequently sample sizes can be highly variable. To address this question, we first evaluated the effect of sample size on precision and statistical power in reporting the frequency of adverse animal welfare outcomes. We next used these findings to assess the precision of published animal welfare investigations for a range of contentious animal use activities, including livestock transport, horse racing, and wildlife harvesting and capture. Finally, we evaluated the sample sizes required for comparing observed outcomes with specified standards through hypothesis testing. Our simulations revealed that the sample sizes required for reasonable levels of precision (i.e., proportional distance to the upper confidence interval limit (δ) of ≤ 0.50) are greater than those that have been commonly used for animal welfare assessments (i.e., >300). Larger sample sizes are required for adverse events with low frequency (i.e., <5%). For comparison with a required threshold standard, even larger samples sizes are required. We present guidelines, and an online calculator, for minimum sample sizes for use in future animal welfare assessments of animal management and research programs.",2019,23,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0211417,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/162b64c49ed1460505b0e472d863ba9db2dce535,JournalArticle,PLoS ONE
0dbe512bb3263c84f9d6f2c27ce22b613f2e5bd0,Simultaneous determination of saflufenacil and three metabolites in five agriculture products using liquid chromatography-Tandem mass spectrometry.,"A reliable and efficient method was firstly established for the simultaneous determination of saflufenacil and its metabolites (M800H02, M800H11 and M800H35) in cereals (soybean and corn) and fruits (apple, grape and orange), based on a triple quadrupole liquid chromatography mass spectrometer. The four target compounds were extracted with acetonitrile and purified by Florisil or Florisil with octadecylsilane from the cereals and fruits. Determination of the targets was achieved within 3.5 min by using Shim-pack GIST C18 column connected to an electrospray ionization source (ESI- mode). The method showed excellent linearity (R2  > 0.9984), and the limits of quantitation were 1 µg/kg for all compounds. Average recoveries were in the range of 74.6%-108.1%, with an intra-day relative standard deviation between 0.9% and 18.3%. The inter-day relative standard deviation was less than 13.8%. The results demonstrate that this method is convenient for monitoring the residues of saflufenacil and its metabolites in food matrices. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Saflufenacil controls many common annual broadleaf weed efficiently, it has been developed and launched into the market by domestic enterprises. Consequently, an analysis method for monitoring saflufenacil in food sample will be urgently needed in China over the next few years. This method provides separation with good specificity within 3.5 min, which is less than previous studies. For the five matrixes, the method presented satisfactory validation parameters in terms of good linearity, low limit of quantitations, and satisfactory accuracy and precision. Therefore, the method established in this study is a valuable tool to overcome gaps in determining saflufenacil and its metabolites in cereals and fruits, in order to accurate evaluation of risk and ensure food safety.",2019,3,0,10.1111/JFBC.12778,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0dbe512bb3263c84f9d6f2c27ce22b613f2e5bd0,JournalArticle,Journal of food biochemistry

The motivation of launching this GNSS SoC is to provide a desirable solution for meeting the requirements of mass market applications, such as small size, low power consumption, affordable expense and accurate positioning information. Therefore, this fully integrated multiband multi-constellation GNSS SoC is capable of tracking all legacy and modernized civil signals (in L1, L2, L5 and L6 band) transmitted by all satellite navigation systems (GPS, BDS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, NAVIC and SBAS). In addition to standard positioning service (SPS) with multi-band multi-constellation GNSS signals, it also provides GNSS raw measurements output via standard radio technical commission for maritime services (RTCM) format and built-in RTK engine with centimeter-level positioning accuracy. Hence it enables any kind of high-precision integrations and applications, such as wearable devices, GIS data collection, precision agriculture, intelligent logistic, intelligent driving, surveying and mapping, and so forth.
In terms of manufacturing processes, it adopts TSMC’s 40 nm process and incorporates a variety of advanced low-power design technologies, making it extremely attractive in terms of size and power consumption. The chip die of Cynosure III architecture is mounted in a 5.0 mm by 5.0 mm quad-flat no-lead (QFN) package, which allows customers to reduce printed circuit board (PCB) and bill of materials (BOM) cost while reducing the number of peripheral devices. The distinguishing characteristic of Cynosure III architecture is that only an analog GNSS radio-frequency (RF) front-end, a digital GNSS baseband, and an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller are integrated for tracking multi-band multi-constellation GNSS signals.

Environmental sensing, and by extension what is referred to as precision or smart agriculture, pose new challenges, especially regarding the collection of environmental data in the presence of connectivity disruptions, their gathering, and their exploitation by end-users or by systems that must perform actions according to the values of those collected data. In this paper, we present a middleware platform for the Internet of Things that implements disruption tolerant opportunistic networking and computing techniques, and that makes it possible to expose and manage physical objects through Web-based protocols, standards and technologies, thus providing interoperability between objects and creating a Web of Things (WoT).

4bb63656c4569411afad325386f9ee6ac423bed1,EDITORIAL,"With pleasure I introduce to you this Special Issue of Irrigation and Drainage with selected and reviewed papers of the 23rd International Congress of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID), which was held in October 2017, Mexico City, Mexico, under the Theme: Modernizing irrigation and drainage for a new Green Revolution. In this issue you will find 12 selected papers that have been recommended by the general reporters and organizers of the Congress Questions, Special Session, Symposium and Workshops that were held during the Congress. The issue starts with the Gulhati Memorial Lecture as presented this time by Felipe Ignacio Arreguin Cortes, Managing Director of the Mexican Institute of Water Technology (IMTA), on Reforms in the administration of irrigation systems: Mexican experiences. The paper presents the process and impact of the transfer of the infrastructure, management and operation of irrigation districts in Mexico from the state to farmers. The paper starts with an overview of the present and future conditions of the hydro-agricultural sector in the country, followed by a discussion of the social background and the legal framework under which the transfer process was planned and carried out. The participation and the organizational framework adopted by the users, which not only remains in force, but has been consolidated, giving rise to a social organization that constitutes an example nationwide, is highlighted. In addition, a series of major challenges, problems and opportunities that need to be addressed in order to meet the current and growing food demand prevailing in the country are discussed. Finally, a reflection is given on the importance of the legal framework of water and its impact on the agricultural sector, highlighting the need to have a General Water Law that is applicable both to the three tiers of government that exist in Mexico and to society at large. In each ICID Congress there are two Questions under which papers can be submitted. In this Congress, Questions 60 and 61 were addressed. They concerned the following issues: Question 60:Water productivity: revisiting the concept in light of the water, energy and food nexus, and Question 61: State of knowledge of irrigation techniques and practicalities within given socio-economic settings. The paper by Abdelhafid Debbahr (Morocco) is based on his general report of Question 60. It aims at giving a summary of the main issues covered by the various contributions. This Question was subdivided into: (i) emerging issues and challenges of water saving, including impact of transferring water out of agriculture; (ii) understanding water productivity, water and energy use efficiency and the water footprint of crops; (iii) water security for growth and development. A summary of the main ideas and findings that emerged, for each subtheme mentioned above, is presented. Major conclusions and recommendations are also included at the end of the paper. The paper by Kunlun Ding (China) on the State of knowledge of irrigation techniques and practicalities within given socio-economic settings is based on his General Report of Question 61 of the 23rd Congress on the same theme. The Question covered three sub-questions: (i) adopting precision irrigation and improving surface irrigation to combat water scarcity; (ii) using information and communication technologies (ICT), remote sensing, control systems and modelling for improved performance of irrigation systems; (iii) adaptability and affordability of new technologies under different socio-economic scenarios. Under the Question, 64 accepted papers covering a wide range of topics of irrigation techniques and practicalities were summarized and reviewed with valuable views and state-of-the-art information/knowledge on the topics concerned. It was concluded that improving surface and precision irrigation are still the major areas in which to achieve objectives of higher agricultural water use efficiency and productivity; that new technologies and their applications in the irrigation sector can help to achieve the objectives; and that addressing ‘adaptability and affordability’ would ensure the real value achieved in practice. The technical activities of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) are organized under four Strategy Themes, namely Knowledge, Schemes, Basin and On-farm. It is a tradition that during each International Executive Council meeting there is a report on one of the Strategy Themes. This time Kunlun Ding presented a report on the Strategy Theme Schemes. This report was prepared in consultation with Ian Makin (United Kingdom) and Irena Bondarik (Russia). The paper was prepared in order to analyse the mandates of the working groups under the Strategy Theme and their appraisal, vision and future directions on the theme, with recommendations for further improvements to enhance the visibility of the technical working groups and further ICID. Two of the best papers on the Questions were selected for this special issue. The first was prepared by Kaluvai Yella Reddy (India) et al. on the theme Adaptation to climate IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE",2019,0,0,10.1002/ird.2325,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4bb63656c4569411afad325386f9ee6ac423bed1,Review,Irrigation and Drainage

The collective behavior of a multi-robot system is governed by its continuous interactions with the physical environment, inter-robot information exchange, and intelligent decision making. Energy-efficient performance, size, weight and scalability of the key sensor, compute, communication, control and actuator components [1–3] of the individual robot platform are critical for realizing efficient advanced systems. In this paper, we demonstrate a distributed, autonomous and collaborative multi-robot system featuring integrated, battery-powered, crawling and jumping minibots for an example search-and-rescue application.

5aba0bcf8ed32cfae9edcd7d60269295706e8157,Crop and Weeds Classification for Precision Agriculture Using Context-Independent Pixel-Wise Segmentation,"Precision agriculture is gaining increasing attention because of the possible reduction of agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilizers and pesticides) that can be obtained by using hightech equipment, including robots. In this paper, we focus on an agricultural robotics system that addresses the weeding problem by means of selective spraying or mechanical removal of the detected weeds. In particular, we describe a deep learning based method to allow a robot to perform an accurate weed/crop classification using a sequence of two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to RGB images. The first network, based on an encoder-decoder segmentation architecture, performs a pixelwise, plant-type agnostic, segmentation between vegetation and soil that enables to extract a set of connected blobs representing plant instances. We show that such network can be trained also using external, ready to use pixel-wise labeled data sets coming from different contexts. Each plant is hence classified between crop and weeds by using the second network. Quantitative experimental results, obtained on real world data, demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve good classification results also on challenging images.",2019,98,6,10.1109/IRC.2019.00029,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5aba0bcf8ed32cfae9edcd7d60269295706e8157,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference on Robotic Computing

However, there are still wide areas of snail inhabited in China which remains a great challenge to achieve the goal of schistosomiasis elimination by 2025. Therefore, a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis on snail control measures is required for precision schistosomiasis control.MethodsThe SWOT approach, which is a well-known structured analysis tool, was used to identify and evaluate the specific characteristics of four types of snail control measures in China, including chemical mollusciciding, forestry, agriculture, and water conservancy projects. The analysis were carried out based on the information collection from literature review, of research papers, books, annual report database of national schistosomiasis control programme in China, reports from the academic forums, and so on.ResultsFor chemical mollusciciding, application strategy needs to focus on specific local settings, such as stage of schistosomiasis control, environmental factors, and limitations from external policies and internal deficiencies. Regarding forestry projects, the optimal strategies are to cooperate with other national forestry programmes to share the investment costs and pay attention on wetland protection. In agriculture projects, it is necessary to develop related cash crop industries and combine with national farmland consolidation projects simultaneously to increase the total economic benefits. Concerning water conservancy projects, the main purpose is to control snail migration from snail area to snail-free areas nationwide.ConclusionsIntegrated strategies for various measures application and a top-level designed cooperation mechanism will be the necessary to eliminate snail and schistosomiasis in China.",2019,24,1,10.1186/s40249-019-0521-0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a2ad5e8d419b8a6fed5fdbc1469b2b413e7ab9a9,"JournalArticle,Review",Infectious Diseases of Poverty

It has focused on the creation of an image-processing algorithm to detect the existence of weeds in a specific site of crops. The main objective has been to obtain a formula so that a weed detection system can be developed through binary classifications. The initial step of image processing is the detection of green plants in order to eliminate all the soil in the image, reducing information that is not necessary. Then, it has focused on the vegetation by segmentation and eliminating unwanted information through medium and morphological filters. Finally, a labeling of objects has been made in the image so that weed detection can be done using a threshold based on the area of detection. This algorithm establishes an accurate monitoring of weeds and can be implemented in automated systems for the eradication of weeds in crops, either through the use of automated sprayers for specific site or a weed-cutting mechanism. In addition, it increases the performance of operational processes in crop management, reducing the time spent searching for weeds throughout a plot of land and focusing weed removal tasks on specific sites for effective control.",2019,8,1,10.1109/CONIELECOMP.2019.8673182,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b985e6fa6081d0dace1bf57f661f0d6155d69931,JournalArticle,"International Conference on Electronics, Communications, and Computers"

cdbeb479576bd4e024c01b7e1c1e1c81a5cd68b6,Applications and Prospects of Agricultural Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Obstacle Avoidance Technology in China,"With the steady progress of China’s agricultural modernization, the demand for agricultural machinery for production is widely growing. Agricultural unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming a new force in the field of precision agricultural aviation in China. In those agricultural areas where ground-based machinery have difficulties in executing farming operations, agricultural UAVs have shown obvious advantages. With the development of precision agricultural aviation technology, one of the inevitable trends is to realize autonomous identification of obstacles and real-time obstacle avoidance (OA) for agricultural UAVs. However, the complex farmland environment and changing obstacles both increase the complexity of OA research. The objective of this paper is to introduce the development of agricultural UAV OA technology in China. It classifies the farmland obstacles in two ways and puts forward the OA zones and related avoidance tactics, which helps to improve the safety of aviation operations. This paper presents a comparative analysis of domestic applications of agricultural UAV OA technology, features, hotspot and future research directions.

d1778a519d73c0dc552266f0bffb660e89194374,Statistics Commentary Series: Commentary No. 31: The Uses and Misuses of the Analysis of Covariance.,"T he analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was developed over 85 years ago by Ronald Fisher, arguably the father of modern statistics. Since that time, it has occupied a seemingly paradoxical position: vastly under-used in situations where it would be of great benefit in analyzing data, yet at the same time used all too frequently when it should not be. In this commentary, I will discuss both sides of this situation. Very briefly, ANCOVA attempts to account for baseline differences between groups for 1 or more “nuisance” variables, or covariates. Fisher introduced ANCOVA as an extension of the analysis of variance (ANOVA), which he also developed. It was designed to improve the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of treatment effects in a study by reducing the variability within each of the groups. It is important to understand the setting in which Fisher worked, because the techniques that arose from his research reflect the issues with which he was grappling. At the time, he was at the Rothamstead Experimental Station, which was devoted to improving the yield of agricultural crops. A typical study might involve splitting a plot of land in half, planting 1 type of seed in 1 part and a different type of seed in the other (hence the term “split-plot design,” still used for some ANOVAs). This helped control other, extraneous factors that might influence growth rate, such as the amount of rainfall or the composition of the soil. The important point to note is that ANCOVA was developed within the framework of an experiment or, as we would label it in medicine today, a randomized controlled trial (RCT). To understand why ANCOVA is so useful in RCTs but not with other types of designs, such as cohort studies, we have to consider 3 types of variables – the dependent variable (DV), the covariates, and the grouping factor (ie, whether the person is assigned to the experimental or comparison group) – and the correlations among them. In an RCT, the covariate (I’ll use the singular, but the argument also applies when there are 2 or more) is correlated with the DV but, due to random assignment, is independent of the grouping factor. Indeed, it is precisely because randomization removes – or at least reduces – the correlation between the covariate and group membership that the RCT is the preferred design when looking at the effectiveness of an intervention. On the other hand, because of the correlation between the covariate and the DV, the variance in the DV that is not related to the grouping factor is reduced. This then strengthens the relationship between the grouping factor and the DV, and thus increases the power of the test. The penalty is the loss of 1 degree of freedom (df) due to the covariate but, if the covariate is chosen wisely, this is more than offset by the gain in precision. This points to 1 part of the paradox: the under-use of ANCOVA. Covariate adjustment reduces variance in the DV even if the covariate does not differ between the groups. To illustrate this, let’s consider the data in Table 1. There are 3 variables: Group assignment, Age (the covariate), and the Score on some measure. The mean age in group 1 is 10.20 ± 1.48 years, and it is 10.10 ± 1.73 years in group 2; it’s hard to conceive of 2 groups being more similar on this variable and, needless to say, the P level is close to 0.9. If we run an ANOVA on the DV (yes, I know we can use a t-test, but then we couldn’t directly compare the results with the ANCOVA), the result for the Group factor is F(1,18) = 2.886, P = 0.107, and there is no reason to break out the wine and celebrate. But now, if we add in Age as a covariate, we would find that F(1,17) = 5.072, P = 0.038 (don’t forget that we lose 1 df because of the covariate). The reason for this increase in power is that we have reduced the variance in Score that is due to Age, thus improving the observed relationship between Score and Group. This also means that we should use a highly reliable measure of the covariate so that we don’t introduce noise due to its measurement. The important take-home message is that when the covariate is correlated with the DV (r = 0.58 in this case), including it in the analysis increases the likelihood of finding a difference, even when the groups do not differ with regard to the covariate.

The International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) traditionally focuses on themes related to agricultural water management that address issues of current global concerns, in its international conferences. The ICID’s International Conference in 2018, consequently, focused on ‘Innovation and Sustainable Agri-water Management: Adapting to a Variable and Changing Climate’ during 12–17 August 2018 in the city of Saskatoon in Canada with relevant three Sub-themes, namely: (1) Competing Water Demands; (2) Resilient Agriculture – Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change; and (3) Irrigation and Drainage in Perspective. Canada has enormous water supplies, but it’s distribution is spatially variable and water resources are at risk because of climate change. Climate change related risks include higher temperatures, lower lake levels, declining glaciers, expanding forest fires, changes from snowmelt driven flooding to summer rainfall flooding, changes in permafrost and collapse of infrastructure associated with that. The Global Water Futures (GWF) aims to provide solutions to water threats in the era of global change; both in terms of science and needs for the economy and to adapt to changing conditions. Agricultural research takes place on the Canadian prairies (wetland drainage, intensive agriculture) and in the great Lakes area (water quality, drainage issues, crop management). The mountain water research is of particular importance to other water for food impacts, as the water generated in the mountains (‘Water Towers’) feeds about 56% of the global population, Dr. John Pomeroy (Canada) observed in the plenary session. Dr Peter McCornick (USA) reflected on water management for productive and resilient agriculture. Climate change is not the only issue we faced in feeding the world: restrictions on land and water are largely drive changes in agricultural practices, he said. Dr Maurice Maloney spoke of the engineering of plants as another method to deliver global food security. We need to grow more food in the next 50 years then we have ever cumulatively since humans emerged, he observed. In the Plenary session, two basic main concerns were highlighted. Firstly, the growing challenges of climate change leading to extreme flood and drought events and secondly, the food security threat for the growing population stemming from unsustainable water use globally. From the Canadian perspective, it was shared that to bring resiliency in the water and agricultural sector, a water security strategy and efficient water management in agriculture were the key requirements. Experts discussed the crop growth technology, productivity, socio-economic value of irrigation, water-food-energy nexus, climate change mitigation and water quality management for efficient agricultural production. The concurrent sessions of the international conference focussed on drainage and flood control strategies, irrigation, drainage and flood control for resilient agriculture, irrigation infrastructure development and climate-smart agriculture and innovative technologies for enhancing water use efficiencies. With relevant examples presented from the Dutch water management systems, the successful approach of keeping lowlands dry for agricultural production was presented. Exceptional irrigation examples of Saskatchewan were also discussed. Combating the severe challenges posed by climate change, an emphasis on creating more robust water infrastructure was highlighted. In other sessions, the role of tools and technologies in increasing the irrigation efficiency was discussed. Modern techniques such as precision agriculture, use of soft computing used for decision support systems, use of remote sensing and geospatial data in combination with the field measurements were discussed at length during these sessions. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AFFC) hosted a workshop on the Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Program administered by AAFC. The workshop featured several presentations who provided an overview of the various research efforts and studies which were carried out under the program. During the conference, FAO conducted sessions on ‘Hydro-economic modelling for transboundary river basin management – towards more Integrated approaches’ and ‘Data-driven improvement of water use efficiency in Small-scale Irrigation.’ The former session deliberated on the challenges pertaining to the sectors competing with agriculture, especially hydropower, particularly in the transboundary regions. Additionally, solutions such as IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE",2019,1,0,10.1002/ird.2334,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fbaadbc0f38dbcdf16359a1b4f36bc50fc53b02f,Review,Irrigation and Drainage

Novel pathogens continue to evolve and emerge. Public health innovation has the potential to open a new front in the war of “our wits against their genes” (Joshua Lederberg). Dense sampling coupled to next generation sequencing can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of microbial characterization while sensor technologies precisely map physical parameters relevant to microbial survival and spread. Microbial, physical, and epidemiological big data could be combined to improve prospective risk identification. However, applied in the wrong way, these approaches may not realize their maximum potential benefits and could even do harm. Minimizing microbial-human interactions would be a mistake. There is evidence that microbes previously thought of at best “benign” may actually enhance human health. Benign and health-promoting microbiomes may, or may not, spread via mechanisms similar to pathogens. Infectious vaccines are approaching readiness to make enhanced contributions to herd immunity. The rigorously defined nature of infectious vaccines contrasts with indigenous “benign or health-promoting microbiomes” but they may converge. A “microbial Neolithic revolution” is a possible future in which human microbial-associations are understood and managed analogously to the macro-agriculture of plants and animals. Tradeoffs need to be framed in order to understand health-promoting potentials of benign, and/or health-promoting microbiomes and infectious vaccines while also discouraging pathogens. Super-spreaders are currently defined as individuals who play an outsized role in the contagion of infectious disease. A key unanswered question is whether the super-spreader concept may apply similarly to health-promoting microbes. The complex interactions of individual rights, community health, pathogen contagion, the spread of benign, and of health-promoting microbiomes including infectious vaccines require study. Advancing the detailed understanding of heterogeneity in microbial spread is very likely to yield important insights relevant to public health.",2019,15,0,10.1186/s12879-019-3715-y,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/60f1445b5e867f960e1a6cd99db51a965a2e9006,"Review,JournalArticle",BMC Infectious Diseases

There are several thermal camera systems in the market that are available at a low cost. However, their efficacy and accuracy in various applications has not been tested. In this study, three commercially available UAV thermal cameras, including ICI 8640 P-series (Infrared Cameras Inc., USA), FLIR Vue Pro R 640 (FLIR Systems, USA), and thermoMap (senseFly, Switzerland) have been tested and evaluated for their potential for forest monitoring, vegetation stress detection, and plant phenotyping. Mounted on multi-rotor or fixed wing systems, these cameras were simultaneously flown over different experimental sites located in St. Louis, Missouri (forest environment), Columbia, Missouri (plant stress detection and phenotyping), and Maricopa, Arizona (high throughput phenotyping). Thermal imagery was calibrated using procedures that utilize a blackbody, handheld thermal spot imager, ground thermal targets, emissivityand atmospheric correction. A suite of statistical analyses, including analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation analysis between camera temperature and plant biophysical and biochemical traits, and heritability were utilized in order to examine the sensitivity and utility of the cameras against selected plant phenotypic traits and in the detection of plant water stress. In addition, in reference to quantitative assessment of image quality from different thermal cameras, a non-reference image quality evaluator, which primarily measures image focus that is based on the spatial relationship of pixels in different scales, was developed. Our results show that (1) UAV-based thermal imaging is a viable tool in precision agriculture and (2) the three examined cameras are comparable in terms of their efficacy for plant phenotyping. Overall, accuracy, when compared against field measured ground temperature and estimating power of plant biophysical and biochemical traits, the ICI 8640 P-series performed better than the other two cameras, followed by FLIR Vue Pro R 640 and thermoMap cameras. Our results demonstrated that all three UAV thermal cameras provide useful temperature data for precision agriculture and plant phenotying, with ICI 8640 P-series presenting the best results among the three systems. Cost wise, FLIR Vue Pro R 640 is more affordable than the other two cameras, providing a less expensive option for a wide range of applications.",2019,206,8,10.3390/RS11030330,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5566a05ae66b61765a9523a9848b0e606251d095,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

Advances in irrigation systems and technologies allow site-specific application of irrigation water within the field to improve water use efficiency or reduce water usage for sustainable crop production, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. This paper discusses recent development of variable-rate irrigation (VRI) technologies, data and information for VRI application, and impacts of VRI, including profitability using this technology, with a focus on agronomic factors in precision water management. The development in sprinkler systems enabled irrigation application with greater precision at the scale of individual nozzle control. Further research is required to evaluate VRI prescription maps integrating different soil and crop characteristics in different environments. On-farm trials and whole-field studies are needed to provide support information for practical VRI applications. Future research also needs to address the adjustment of the spatial distribution of prescription zones in response to temporal variability in soil water status and crop growing conditions, which can be evaluated by incorporating remote and proximal sensing data. Comprehensive decision support tools are required to help the user decide where to apply how much irrigation water at different crop growth stages to optimize water use and crop production based on the regional climate conditions and cropping systems.",2019,104,1,10.3390/AGRONOMY9020087,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/85b0116f6ea0ec625a865015b9276cad9859be42,Review,Agronomy

Agriculture will have to increase its output to meet demand, opening the door to increased automation and technological innovation; intensified, sustainable farming; and precision livestock farming (PLF) applications. Early indicators of medical problems, which use sensors to alert cattle farmers early concerning individual animals that need special care, are proliferating. Wearable technologies dominate the market. In less-value-per-animal systems like sheep, goat, pig, poultry, and fish, one sensor, like a camera or robot per herd/flock/school, rather than one sensor per animal, will become common. PLF sensors generate huge amounts of data, and many actors benefit from PLF data. No standards currently exist for sharing sensor-generated data, limiting the use of commercial sensors. Technologies providing accurate data can enhance a well-managed farm.

The advances in supercomputing, data storage capacity, and cloud platforms enable scientists throughout the world to generate, analyze, share, and store vast amounts of data, some of which are biological and much of which may be used to understand the human condition, agricultural systems, evolution, and environmental ecosystems. These advances and applications have enabled: (1) the emergence of data science, which involves the development of new algorithms to analyze and visualize data; and (2) the use of engineering approaches to manipulate or create new biological organisms that have specific functions, such as production of industrial chemical precursors and development of environmental bio-based sensors. Several biological sciences fields harness the capabilities of computer, data, and engineering sciences, including synthetic biology, precision medicine, precision agriculture, and systems biology. These advances and applications are not limited to one country. This capability has economic and physical consequences, but is vulnerable to unauthorized intervention. Healthcare and genomic information of patients, information about pharmaceutical and biotechnology products in development, and results of scientific research have been stolen by state and non-state actors through infiltration of databases and computer systems containing this information. Countries have developed their own policies for governing data generation, access, and sharing with foreign entities, resulting in asymmetry of data sharing.

The current U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) regulatory testing for E. coli O157:H7 uses the method described in the USDA-FSIS Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook (MLG), chapter 5. At times, described presumptive test results are nonconfirmable, suggesting that recent PCR technological advancements and presumed enhanced sensitivity and specificity may offer beneficial changes. Here, we have evaluated the precision and sensitivity of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based real-time PCR assay called ECO for the detection of E. coli O157:H7. ECO detects the gene target specific to both E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli O157:non-H7 but distinguishes the two by using a melt curve analysis. A total of 3,113 O157:H7 and O157:non-H7 isolates were used to define this melting temperature-based criteria. The simulated comparative performance evaluation in the spiked beef samples indicated detection of 3 of 3 samples by ECO at <3.3 log CFU/mL, whereas MLG only detected 1 of 3 (<3.3 log CFU/mL). Using modified tryptic soy broth-enriched natural beef and veal product samples ( n = 452), the comparative sensitivity, specificity, false-positive rate, and false-negative rate against culture between MLG and ECO were 75 versus 92%, 91 versus 99%, 8.9 versus 0.77%, and 25 versus 8.3%, respectively. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the overall accuracy were found to be 56 versus 94%, 96 versus 98%, and 88 versus 98%, for MLG and ECO, respectively. These data demonstrate that the ECO assay is comparable to MLG detection of E. coli O157:H7 and offers improved sensitivity.",2019,5,0,10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-366,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ba791950e5bab2d7fb85e749c24babcaffbda8e,JournalArticle,Journal of Food Protection
5c52bec242ac371c1c223f184e689871d2fab935,Mr4Soil: A MapReduce-Based Framework Integrated with GIS for Soil Erosion Modelling,"A soil erosion model is used to evaluate the conditions of soil erosion and guide agricultural production. Recently, high spatial resolution data have been collected in new ways, such as three-dimensional laser scanning, providing the foundation for refined soil erosion modelling. However, serial computing cannot fully meet the computational requirements of massive data sets. Therefore, it is necessary to perform soil erosion modelling under a parallel computing framework. This paper focuses on a parallel computing framework for soil erosion modelling based on the Hadoop platform. The framework includes three layers: the methodology, algorithm, and application layers. In the methodology layer, two types of parallel strategies for data splitting are defined as row-oriented and sub-basin-oriented methods. The algorithms for six parallel calculation operators for local, focal and zonal computing tasks are designed in detail. These operators can be called to calculate the model factors and perform model calculations. We defined the key-value data structure of GeoCSV format for vector, row-based and cell-based rasters as the inputs for the algorithms. A geoprocessing toolbox is developed and integrated with the geographic information system (GIS) platform in the application layer. The performance of the framework is examined by taking the Gushanchuan basin as an example. The results show that the framework can perform calculations involving large data sets with high computational efficiency and GIS integration. This approach is easy to extend and use and provides essential support for applying high-precision data to refine soil erosion modelling.",2019,3,0,10.3390/IJGI8030103,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c52bec242ac371c1c223f184e689871d2fab935,JournalArticle,ISPRS Int.

Acetamiprid-ovalbumin conjugates (ACE-OVA) and goat anti-mouse IgG were sprayed onto a nitrocellulose membrane as a test and control line. Two kinds of anti-acetamiprid monoclonal antibodies (mAb) obtained in our lab were characterized by the ELISA and surface plasmon resonance assay. The competitive immunoassay was established using a QDs-mAb conjugate probe. The visual detection limit of acetamiprid for a qualitative threshold was set as 1 ng/mL to the naked eye. In the quantitative test, the fluorescence intensity was measured by a portable strip reader and a standard curve was obtained with a linear range from 0.098 to 25 ng/mL, and the half maximal inhibitory concentration of 1.12 ng/mL. The developed method showed no evident cross-reactivities with other neonicotinoid insecticides except for thiacloprid (36.68%). The accuracy and precision of the developed QDs-ICS were further evaluated. Results showed that the average recoveries ranged from 78.38 to 126.97% in agricultural samples. Moreover, to test blind tea samples, the QDs-ICS showed comparable reliability and a high correlation with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The whole sample detection could be accomplished within 1 h. In brief, our data clearly manifested that QDs-ICS was quite qualified for the rapid and sensitive screening of acetamiprid residues in an agricultural product analysis and paves the way to point-of-care testing for other analytes.",2019,31,3,10.3389/fchem.2019.00076,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66d3da40783617c00c9d36f620cae5db2ec46b13,JournalArticle,Frontiers in Chemistry

Elgon, Cherangany Forested Ecosystems and entire River Nzoia Catchment in Kenya","Water availability for both domestic and industrial use is a major growing problem in the developing countries including Kenya. The situation is further worsened by increasing human population and climate change, probably the most complex environmental problem facing the world today. Mt. Elgon and Cherangany hills forest ecosystems in the River Nzoia Catchment are threatened by the increase in local population. This is causing environmental degradation and disruption in the catchment areas resulting in drying up of streams and rivers and both water and soil pollution. The objective of this study was to conduct a baseline survey to provide information on the status of water quality in the River Nzoia Catchment and an overview of pollution levels, sources and possible mitigation measures. The study was carried out in August 2017 during the short rains. Water and sediments from 26 spatially distributed sites on rivers in the catchment were sampled and analyzed. The water quality (physical and chemical) was assessed through analysis of water and sediments. Both water and sediments were analyzed following the standard analytical methods. All the rivers in the watersheds forming the River Nzoia catchment contained high levels of iron in water which exceeded permitted levels for drinking without treatment and for domestic uses in the environmental. In addition, the turbidity levels of water were beyond accepted limits set for drinking water and environmental water standards. There was little pollution of water from heavy metals. River Nzoia near Webuye town and Sigomre bridge were the most polluted waters with levels of nitrates, iron, copper, chromium, with BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) exceeding the accepted limits in the environment. For sediments, the contents of copper, magnesium and iron were high in the upper catchment of River Nzoia (foot slopes of Mt. Elgon). The levels of nitrates and phosphates in the sediments were high in the lower parts of the catchment. The recommended interventions to manage point or non-point pollution sources include: land and soil conservation to reduce erosion, precision in fertilizer usage, proper sewage and industrial effluent treatment and disposal. The mitigation measures should be at the sub-catchment level to reduce land, soil and water pollution. Technologies for soil and water conservation including afforestation on bare lands, control of overland flow, reduction on river bank cultivation and conservation agriculture practices will reduce pollution and conserve the environment.",2019,4,0,10.17265/2162-5263/2019.02.001,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/88569bd546fce79c64d989d1fc3df0b1c137d9f4,Review,Journal of Environmental Science and Engineering B
e7575c00fc4c33337b8cde27cb1e194bfda7511a,A Survey on Deep Learning Based IoT Approach for Precision Crop Suggestion,": Agriculture plays the main role in a country's economic development. In the recent agricultural practices, the variation in climatic phenomena affects the weather conditions in different regions and based on that the soil characteristics may also vary. This influences the crop to be sown for getting a better yield. In agriculture with the advent of new technology, farming practices are now converted into precision farming. It includes the use of modern technology such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Data Analytics for optimal crop health and crop productivity. This improves the growth rate of the crops, but the problem among farmers is they are not choosing the right crop at right time. Although several algorithms are there the Deep Learning based Artificial Neural Networks is found to be more effective for prediction and modeling. The algorithm accuracy and the prediction level vary based on the type of parameters chosen. The proposed system helps the farmers by gathering information about the basic characteristics of their soil such as soil moisture level, temperature, pH, and humidity. In addition, the sensor provides valuable information about crops such as sowing time, fertilizer suggestion and real-time monitoring. These data can be collected using sensors and with the help of that data, the Deep Learning technique such as Deep Neural Network (DNN) which is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can be applied to end up with valuable decision making.",2019,2,0,10.22214/IJRASET.2019.2049,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7575c00fc4c33337b8cde27cb1e194bfda7511a,Review,International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology

In order to apply advanced deep-learning technology to complete various agricultural tasks in online and offline ways, a large number of crop vision datasets with domain-specific annotation are urgently needed. To encourage further progress in challenging realistic agricultural conditions, we present the CropDeep species classification and detection dataset, consisting of 31,147 images with over 49,000 annotated instances from 31 different classes. In contrast to existing vision datasets, images were collected with different cameras and equipment in greenhouses, captured in a wide variety of situations. It features visually similar species and periodic changes with more representative annotations, which have supported a stronger benchmark for deep-learning-based classification and detection. To further verify the application prospect, we provide extensive baseline experiments using state-of-the-art deep-learning classification and detection models. Results show that current deep-learning-based methods achieve well performance in classification accuracy over 99%. While current deep-learning methods achieve only 92% detection accuracy, illustrating the difficulty of the dataset and improvement room of state-of-the-art deep-learning models when applied to crops production and management.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is one promising technique to achieve precision agriculture, which is expected to greatly increase yields. However, the large-scale application of IoT systems in agriculture is facing challenges such as huge investment in agriculture IoT systems and non-tech-savvy farmers. To identify these challenges, we summarize the applications of IoT techniques in agriculture in four categories: controlled environment planting, open-field planting, livestock breeding, and aquaculture and aquaponics. The focus on implementing agriculture IoT systems is suggested to be expanded from the growth cycle to the agri-products life cycle. Meanwhile, the energy concern should be considered in the implementation of agriculture IoT systems. The construction of green IoT systems in the whole life cycle of agri-products will have great impact on farmers' interest in IoT techniques. With the life cycle framework, emerging finance, operation, and management (FOM) issues in the implementation of green IoT systems in agriculture are observed, such as IoT finance, supply chain and big data financing, network nodes recharging and repairing, and IoT data management. These FOM issues call for innovative farm production modes and new types of agribusiness enterprises.",2019,163,1,10.1109/MCOM.2019.1800332,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/241f58d5df56c3ea01ce28cb9a4d74a2111280b0,JournalArticle,IEEE Communications Magazine

The solar activity changes ionospheric conditions. In the specific, a solar storm hitting the Earth may change the ExB drift, leading to a suppression or to an intensification of the Equatorial Fountain. This result into a change in the mechanism regulating the formation of the plasma bubbles, and has strong dependence on the local time of the storm development. The regular and irregular behavior of the low latitude ionosphere in producing scintillation-effective irregularities pose then a challenge to model and predict the disruption of GNSS signals [1]. Mitigation of the degradation of the GNSS performance due to presence of ionospheric irregularities, i.e. the equatorial plasma bubbles, is of paramount importance for high-precision applications, such as precision agriculture.",2019,0,0,10.23919/URSIAP-RASC.2019.8738621,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/292e93f8f31c2f984c0b2a3007a0fa78565f98bf,Conference,URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference

It produces all the necessary needs such as wheat, rice, fruits, grains which are consumed by a human for everyday survival. So, it is important for the country to develop and sustain a productive agricultural system. As demand is increasing for food, food security is very important to sustain and increase yield production at a higher rate and at the same time preserve the ecosystem. So, the technologies in the agricultural domain may be incorporated to enhance food supplies and production. In many countries like the USA, China and Israel have a prominently high implementation of technologies with a high rate of food production and even exported in many parts of the world. These countries have implemented advanced techniques such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithm for agriculture domain.

599032dec2bf15f4d2b1ce920b715a5062800010,Stem–Leaf Segmentation and Phenotypic Trait Extraction of Individual Maize Using Terrestrial LiDAR Data,"Accurate and high throughput extraction of crop phenotypic traits, as a crucial step of molecular breeding, is of great importance for yield increasing. However, automatic stem–leaf segmentation as a prerequisite of many precise phenotypic trait extractions is still a big challenge. Current works focus on the study of the 2-D image-based segmentation, which are sensitive to illumination and occlusion. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can obtain accurate 3-D information with its active laser scanning and strong penetration ability, which breaks through phenotyping from 2-D to 3-D. However, few researches have addressed the problem of the LiDAR-based stem–leaf segmentation. In this paper, we proposed a median normalized-vector growth (MNVG) algorithm, which can segment stem and leaf with four steps, i.e., preprocessing, stem growth, leaf growth, and postprocessing. The MNVG method was tested by 30 maize samples with different heights, compactness, leaf numbers, and densities from three growing stages. Moreover, phenotypic traits at leaf, stem, and individual levels were extracted with the truly segmented instances. The mean accuracy of segmentation at point level in terms of the recall, precision, F-score, and overall accuracy were 0.92, 0.93, 0.92, and 0.93, respectively. The accuracy of phenotypic trait extraction in leaf, stem, and individual levels ranged from 0.81 to 0.95, 0.64 to 0.97, and 0.96 to 1, respectively. To our knowledge, this paper proposed the first LiDAR-based stem–leaf segmentation and phenotypic trait extraction method in agriculture field, which may contribute to the study of LiDAR-based plant phonemics and precise agriculture.",2019,136,8,10.1109/TGRS.2018.2866056,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/599032dec2bf15f4d2b1ce920b715a5062800010,JournalArticle,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing

a384d83d6d1e01c0c82aea8d9bdf4597b2724bdf,Rapid UHPLC-MS metabolite profiling and phenotypic assays reveal genotypic impacts of nitrogen supplementation in oats,"Oats (Avena sativa L.) are a whole grain cereal recognised for their health benefits and which are cultivated largely in temperate regions providing both a source of food for humans and animals, as well as being used in cosmetics and as a potential treatment for a number of diseases. Oats are known as being a cereal source high in dietary fibre (e.g. β-glucans), as well as being high in antioxidants, minerals and vitamins. Recently, oats have been gaining increased global attention due to their large number of beneficial health effects. Consumption of oats has been proven to lower blood LDL cholesterol levels and blood pressure, thus reducing the risk of heart disease, as well as reducing blood-sugar and insulin levels. Oats are seen as a low input cereal. Current agricultural guidelines on nitrogen application are believed to be suboptimal and only consider the effect of nitrogen on grain yield. It is important to understand the role of both variety and of crop management in determining nutritional quality of oats. In this study the response of yield, grain quality and grain metabolites to increasing nitrogen application to levels greater than current guidelines were investigated. Four winter oat varieties (Mascani, Tardis, Balado and Gerald) were grown in a replicated nitrogen response trial consisting of a no added nitrogen control and four added nitrogen treatments between 50 and 200 kg N ha−1 in a randomised split-plot design. Grain yield, milling quality traits, β-glucan, total protein and oil content were assessed. The de-hulled oats (groats) were also subjected to a rapid Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography—Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) metabolomic screening approach. Application of nitrogen had a significant effect on grain yield but there was no significant difference between the response of the four varieties. Grain quality traits however displayed significant differences both between varieties and nitrogen application level. β-glucan content significantly increased with nitrogen application. The UHPLC-MS approach has provided a rapid, sub 15 min per sample, metabolite profiling method that is repeatable and appropriate for the screening of large numbers of cereal samples. The method captured a wide range of compounds, inclusive of primary metabolites such as the amino acids, organic acids, vitamins and lipids, as well as a number of key secondary metabolites, including the avenanthramides, caffeic acid, and sinapic acid and its derivatives and was able to identify distinct metabolic phenotypes for the varieties studied. Amino acid metabolism was massively upregulated by nitrogen supplementation as were total protein levels, whilst the levels of organic acids were decreased, likely due to them acting as a carbon skeleton source. Several TCA cycle intermediates were also impacted, potentially indicating increased TCA cycle turn over, thus providing the plant with a source of energy and reductant power to aid elevated nitrogen assimilation. Elevated nitrogen availability was also directed towards the increased production of nitrogen containing phospholipids. A number of both positive and negative impacts on the metabolism of phenolic compounds that have influence upon the health beneficial value of oats and their products were also observed. Although the developed method has broad applicability as a rapid screening method or a rapid metabolite profiling method and in this study has provided valuable metabolic insights, it still must be considered that much greater confidence in metabolite identification, as well as quantitative precision, will be gained by the application of higher resolution chromatography methods, although at a large expense to sample throughput. Follow up studies will apply higher resolution GC (gas chromatography) and LC (reversed phase and HILIC) approaches, oats will be also analysed from across multiple growth locations and growth seasons, effectively providing a cross validation for the results obtained within this preliminary study. It will also be fascinating to perform more controlled experiments with sampling of green tissues, as well as oat grains, throughout the plants and grains development, to reveal greater insight of carbon and nitrogen metabolism balance, as well as resource partitioning into lipid and secondary metabolism.",2019,16,0,10.1007/s11306-019-1501-x,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a384d83d6d1e01c0c82aea8d9bdf4597b2724bdf,JournalArticle,Metabolomics

The progress in such systems has brought large potential to improve human life quality, such as improved health care services, energy consumption and food supply chain system (FSC). In particular, FSC plays an important role in human beings. It comes from the complex agricultural system and lead up to human dining table. The fusion of CPS and agricultural system could improve the quality of food and environment. Therefore, many studies have been conducted to tackle the challenges in this domain, such as lack of information systems and infrastructures, poor collaboration toward larger Internet of Things solutions and dynamic changes of intrinsic and extrinsic conditions of enabler technology in precision agriculture. In this work, we focus on developing an initial framework that could improve prediction rate and handling imprecise data due to the dynamic problem in precision agriculture.

In case of GNSS, stand-alone, single receiver-based position solution accuracy may not be enough in many applications like automated transporting service, unmanned air vehicle, Geodesy and agriculture etc and GNSS mass market needs low cost high accurate position solution. Carrier phase measurement-based position solution is more precise than code-based measurement, but phase ambiguity is a problem in carrier phase-based measurement. Real time Kinematic (RTK) technique is a method where precise position solution can be obtained using Network Transfer of RTCM message through IP (NTRIP) protocol; here multiple signal messages (MSM) are also sent from the GNSS base station to the rover and Carrier ambiguity can be resolved. This research work focuses on the RTK performance of geodetic, survey-grade receivers and low-cost receivers and analysis on their comparative performances. Geodetic receiver uses its own algorithm to calculate RTK solution and for the low-cost receivers, an open-source GNSS data processing software, RTKLib has been used. A static survey is made and found that low cost receivers can provide sub meter level precision in RTK operation which may help in GNSS mass market application and solution development.",2019,36,1,10.23919/URSIAP-RASC.2019.8738736,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d295e6589e83a659e3d5974d9ac4b5975bfcc753,"Conference,Review",URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference

This process was successfully launched by the 'machinery revolution' of the 1920s, the use of protophytotrons and inductive mutagenesis in plant breeding in the 1930s, and the adoption of radionuclides method for agricultural monitoring in the 1940s. The development of this trend was then delayed by the spread of Lysenkoism in the 1940–1960s. However, from the 1980s, a global strategy of 'precision agriculture' (PA) evolved, which was related to the ecological and energy-saving approaches towards agroindustry practice. These approaches relied heavily on space agricultural technologies in the USSR in the 1970–1980s. PA strategy is based on the use of global positioning systems, geographic information systems, as well as sensors for remote measurements and onboard sensors that command agricultural machinery. This paper discusses the contribution of the Soviet scientists and engineers to the development of technological innovations, including PA, as well as obstacles to, and issues with, their application in Russia.",2019,1,0,10.1109/ENT.2019.00027,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d4b633449605df5a59f4ef3e388993e0b1a7b667,Conference,2019 International Conference on Engineering Technologies and Computer Science (EnT)

Economic conditions of developing countries force farmers to use traditional practices rather than adopting latest technologies which are capable of producing better yield. Practices like Precision Agriculture are being incorporated all over the world to help farmers to get better crop yield. Precision Agriculture is the concept of real-time observation of soil parameters like temperature, water content, moisture etc. In present work, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to sense and store data of agricultural field. To increase the acceptance of this technology in agriculture, cost effective and energy efficient system is required. Modified Zonal Stable Election Protocol (M-ZSEP) which follows hybrid routing for heterogeneous networks has been realized for agricultural field. WSN collects data through real time monitoring and then transmit it to the Base Station (BS). Data received is then displayed at base station to achieve monitoring of various soil parameters for efficient use of resources. Result indicate that M-ZSEP outperforms traditional protocols in terms of throughput and stability period which in turn will increase the lifetime of nodes and further make proposed network energy efficient.",2019,8,0,10.1109/SPIN.2019.8711694,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd4f6854347e7bac4b7268cbf80b8c4580b34c0e,Conference,SPIN
f4832b5f0de3aca25ee37345212122c8a12518c7,Using a Portable Active Sensor to Monitor Growth Parameters and Predict Grain Yield of Winter Wheat,"Rapid and effective acquisition of crop growth information is a crucial step of precision agriculture for making in-season management decisions. Active canopy sensor GreenSeeker (Trimble Navigation Limited, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is a portable device commonly used for non-destructively obtaining crop growth information. This study intended to expand the applicability of GreenSeeker in monitoring growth status and predicting grain yield of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Four field experiments with multiple wheat cultivars and N treatments were conducted during 2013–2015 for obtaining canopy normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ratio vegetation index (RVI) synchronized with four agronomic parameters: leaf area index (LAI), leaf dry matter (LDM), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), and leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA). Duration models based on NDVI and RVI were developed to monitor these parameters, which indicated that NDVI and RVI explained 80%, 68–70%, 10–12%, and 67–73% of the variability in LAI, LDM, LNC and LNA, respectively. According to the validation results, the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) were all <0.24 and the relative error (RE) were all <23%. Considering the variation among different wheat cultivars, the newly normalized vegetation indices rNDVI (NDVI vs. the NDVI for the highest N rate) and rRVI (RVI vs. the RVI for the highest N rate) were calculated to predict the relative grain yield (RY, the yield vs. the yield for the highest N rate). rNDVI and rRVI explained 77–85% of the variability in RY, the RRMSEs were both <0.13 and the REs were both <6.3%. The result demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring growth parameters and predicting grain yield of winter wheat with portable GreenSeeker sensor.",2019,55,1,10.3390/s19051108,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4832b5f0de3aca25ee37345212122c8a12518c7,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

As a result, some emerging mycotoxins have been shown to occur frequently in agricultural products. In this study, a sensitive and reliable method for the determination of 10 emerging mycotoxins (beauvericin, enniatin A, enniatin A1, enniatin B, enniatin B1, alternariol, alternariol monomethyl ether, altenuene, tentoxin, and tenuazonic acid) in 12 different food matrices (cereals, legumes, potatoes, meats, eggs, aquatic foods, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, sugars, beverages, and alcohol beverages) was developed and validated. After a simple extraction, a one-step sample clean-up by a HLB solid phase extraction (SPE) column was sufficient for all 12 food matrices prior to analysis with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Isotope internal standards 13C-TeA, TEN-d3, and 13C-AFB2 were used for accurate quantification. Validation in terms of linearity, selectivity, sensitivity, accuracy, and precision (intra and inter-day variability) were evaluated for the 10 mycotoxins in all selected matrices. The sensitivity varied from 0.0004 to 0.3 ng mL−1 (limits of detection) and from 0.002 to 0.9 ng mL−1 (limits of quantitation). The recoveries of 10 mycotoxins in fortified samples were from 60.6% to 164% including very low spiking levels in all 12 food matrices, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 12%. The proposed methodology was applied to the analysis of 60 samples collected from five provinces within the 6th China Total Diet Study with the results discussed in detail. The advantages of sensitivity, accuracy, and robustness made it a powerful tool for emerging mycotoxin monitoring and dietary exposure assessment.",2019,25,3,10.3390/toxins11030166,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa9bb2ccc87d843ffc7f67b27c42053dd024141e,JournalArticle,Toxins
abae0aba70deefad57cc42da3a9487ff19fa8562,Detecting Invasive Insects with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"A key aspect to controlling and reducing the effects invasive insect species have on agriculture is to obtain knowledge about the migration patterns of these species. Current state-of-the-art methods of studying these migration patterns involve a mark-release-recapture technique, in which insects are released after being marked and researchers attempt to recapture them later. However, this approach involves a human researcher manually searching for these insects in large fields and results in very low recapture rates. In this paper, we propose an automated system for detecting released insects using an unmanned aerial vehicle. This system utilizes ultraviolet lighting technology, digital cameras, and lightweight computer vision algorithms to more quickly and accurately detect insects compared to the current state of the art. The efficiency and accuracy that this system provides will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of invasive insect species migration patterns.

be8c2889004ec3589bba091679a2f4cdb552707f,Quantifying Lodging Percentage and Lodging Severity Using a UAV-Based Canopy Height Model Combined with an Objective Threshold Approach,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) open new opportunities in precision agriculture and phenotyping because of their flexibility and low cost. In this study, the potential of UAV imagery was evaluated to quantify lodging percentage and lodging severity of barley using structure from motion (SfM) techniques. Traditionally, lodging quantification is based on time-consuming manual field observations. Our UAV-based approach makes use of a quantitative threshold to determine lodging percentage in a first step. The derived lodging estimates showed a very high correlation to reference data (R2 = 0.96, root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.66%) when applied to breeding trials, which could also be confirmed under realistic farming conditions. As a second step, an approach was developed that allows the assessment of lodging severity, information that is important to estimate yield impairment, which also takes the intensity of lodging events into account. Both parameters were tested on three ground sample distances. The lowest spatial resolution acquired from the highest flight altitude (100 m) still led to high accuracy, which increases the practicability of the method for large areas. Our new lodging assessment procedure can be used for insurance applications, precision farming, and selecting for genetic lines with greater lodging resistance in breeding research.",2019,65,4,10.3390/RS11050515,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/be8c2889004ec3589bba091679a2f4cdb552707f,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing
7ef4c6611326648d350a9dd3dd2d5f67a8d3ef78,An EU Perspective on Biosafety Considerations for Plants Developed by Genome Editing and Other New Genetic Modification Techniques (nGMs),"The question whether new genetic modification techniques (nGM) in plant development might result in non-negligible negative effects for the environment and/or health is significant for the discussion concerning their regulation. However, current knowledge to address this issue is limited for most nGMs, particularly for recently developed nGMs, like genome editing, and their newly emerging variations, e.g., base editing. This leads to uncertainties regarding the risk/safety-status of plants which are developed with a broad range of different nGMs, especially genome editing, and other nGMs such as cisgenesis, transgrafting, haploid induction or reverse breeding. A literature survey was conducted to identify plants developed by nGMs which are relevant for future agricultural use. Such nGM plants were analyzed for hazards associated either (i) with their developed traits and their use or (ii) with unintended changes resulting from the nGMs or other methods applied during breeding. Several traits are likely to become particularly relevant in the future for nGM plants, namely herbicide resistance (HR), resistance to different plant pathogens as well as modified composition, morphology, fitness (e.g., increased resistance to cold/frost, drought, or salinity) or modified reproductive characteristics. Some traits such as resistance to certain herbicides are already known from existing GM crops and their previous assessments identified issues of concern and/or risks, such as the development of herbicide resistant weeds. Other traits in nGM plants are novel; meaning they are not present in agricultural plants currently cultivated with a history of safe use, and their underlying physiological mechanisms are not yet sufficiently elucidated. Characteristics of some genome editing applications, e.g., the small extent of genomic sequence change and their higher targeting efficiency, i.e., precision, cannot be considered an indication of safety per se, especially in relation to novel traits created by such modifications. All nGMs considered here can result in unintended changes of different types and frequencies. However, the rapid development of nGM plants can compromise the detection and elimination of unintended effects. Thus, a case-specific premarket risk assessment should be conducted for nGM plants, including an appropriate molecular characterization to identify unintended changes and/or confirm the absence of unwanted transgenic sequences.",2019,84,7,10.3389/fbioe.2019.00031,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ef4c6611326648d350a9dd3dd2d5f67a8d3ef78,"JournalArticle,Review",Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology

Mapping 30-m winter wheat cropland can provide beneficial reference information that is necessary for understanding food security. To date, machine learning algorithms have become an effective tool for the rapid identification of winter wheat at regional scales. Algorithm implementation is based on constructing and selecting many features, which makes feature set optimization an important issue worthy of discussion. In this study, the accurate mapping of winter wheat at 30-m resolution was realized using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data, and a random forest algorithm. This paper also discusses the optimal combination of features suitable for cropland extraction. The results revealed that: (1) the random forest algorithm provided robust performance using multi-features (MFs), multi-feature subsets (MFSs), and multi-patterns (MPs) as input parameters. Moreover, the highest accuracy (94%) for winter wheat extraction occurred in three zones, including: pure farmland, urban mixed areas, and forest areas. (2) Spectral reflectance and the crop growth period were the most essential features for crop extraction. The MFSs combined with the three to four feature types enabled the high-precision extraction of 30-m winter wheat plots. (3) The extraction accuracy of winter wheat in three zones with multiple geographical environments was affected by certain dominant features, including spectral bands (B), spectral indices (S), and time-phase characteristics (D). Therefore, we can improve the winter wheat mapping accuracy of the three regional types by improving the spectral resolution, constructing effective spectral indices, and enriching vegetation information. The results of this paper can help effectively construct feature sets using the random forest algorithm, thus simplifying the feature construction workload and ensuring high-precision extraction results in future winter wheat mapping research.",2019,32,0,10.3390/rs11050535,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e762af178ff2636fcd67151ef393e34d1e843949,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

Convolutional Neural Networks-based researches reach a great improvement on detection tasks in natural scene images enjoying from the strong ability of feature representations. However, because of the high density, the small size of objects, and the intricate background, the current methods achieve relatively low precision in aerial images. The intention of this work is to obtain better detection performance in aerial images by designing a novel deep neural network framework called Feature Fusion Deep Networks (FFDN). The novel architecture combines a designed structural learning layer based on a graphical model. As a result, the network not only provides powerful hierarchical representation but also strengthens the spatial relationship between the high-density objects. We demonstrate the great improvement of the proposed FFDN on the UAV123 data set and another novel challenging data set called UAVDT benchmark.

The Hatheway method indicated several optimum sizes of experimental units, many of which were applicable for evaluation experiments of cassava cultivars. The 15 x 1 rectangular experimental unit (15 rows with one plant and 9.00 m² of useful area) was considered the ideal shape for assessment of cassava production, which was smaller than the size suggested in surveys with of cassava cropping.

Assessment is made of agrarian sustainability in the country at various level using aggregate macro and farm level micro data. 
The assessment has found out that there is a considerable differentiation in the level of integral and aspects sustainability of different type of farms, ecosystems, subsectors and regions. Nevertheless, results on the integral agrarian sustainability based on macro aggregate and micro farm data are quite similar. The later indicates that both approaches are reliable and could be simultaneously used according to the level of analysis, needs of decision makers, and available data. 
Major factors encouraging improving economic sustainability are market demand and price; direct state subsidies; market competition; financial capability; participation in public support programs; possibility of benefitting immediately; possibility of benefitting in the near future; tax preferences; possibility of benefitting in the long term; and integration with buyers of farm products. Main factors encouraging the enhancement of social sustainability are personal convictions and satisfaction; social recognition of individual contribution; immediate benefits for other people and groups; regional community initiatives and pressure; access to advisory services; European Union policy; and existing regional problems and risks. Important factors encouraging environmental sustainability are problems and risks existing at the global scale; official regulations, standards, and norms; existing regional problems and risks; and European Union policies. 
Public policies and instruments that improve economic sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture include: direct area-based payments; national top-ups for products and livestock; modernization of agricultural holdings; green payments; support for semi-market farms. At the same time the impact of national and European policies on social and environmental sustainability is relatively weak. 
Having in mind the importance of holistic assessments of this kind for improving agrarian sustainability, farm management and agrarian policies, they are to be expended and their precision and representation increased. The latter requires a closer cooperation between and participation of all interested parties as well as improvement of the precision through enlargement of collected statistical data, number of surveyed farms, and incorporating more “objective” data from field tests and surveys, monitoring, expertise of professionals in the area, etc.",2019,0,0,10.2139/ssrn.3352814,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66889df343ac5eb1d017350e303071c1cc30f79c,Review,Social Science Research Network

7d82c6a41e903bd55170633d13bf59f0a3050511,Improvement of the 15 N gas flux method for in situ measurement of soil denitrification and its product stoichiometry.,"RATIONALE
Field measurement of denitrification in agricultural ecosystems using the 15 N gas flux method has been limited by poor sensitivity because current isotope ratio mass spectrometry is not precise enough to detect low 15 N2 fluxes in the presence of a high atmospheric N2 background. For laboratory studies, detection limits are improved by incubating soils in closed systems and under N2 -depleted atmospheres.


METHODS
We developed a new procedure to conduct the 15 N gas flux method suitable for field application using an artificially N2 -depleted atmosphere to improve the detection limit at the given precision of mass spectrometry. Laboratory experiments with and without 15 N-labelling and using different flushing strategies were conducted to develop a suitable field method. Subsequently, this method was tested in the field and results were compared with those obtained from the conventional 15 N gas flux method.


RESULTS
Results of the two methods were in close agreement showing that the denitrification rates determined were not biased by the flushing procedure. Best sensitivity for N2  + N2 O fluxes was 10 ppb, which was 80-fold better than that of the reference method. Further improvement can be achieved by lowering the N2 background concentration below the values established in the present study.


CONCLUSIONS
In view of this progress in sensitivity, the new method will be suitable to measure denitrification dynamics in the field beyond peak events.",2019,33,2,10.1002/rcm.8363,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d82c6a41e903bd55170633d13bf59f0a3050511,JournalArticle,Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry

Image segmentation is one of the first steps to identify the region of interest within an image. This paper presents an approach to automatic segmentation and classification of healthy and defective Carabao mangoes. K-means, range filtering and color-channel segmentation were utilized so that the varying texture and color of mangoes due to the surface defects can be considered. Results show that the proposed technique performs better than the classical K-means segmentation. The performance of segmentation step has a considerable influence on the precision of the classification model. Segmented and not segmented images were trained using KNN, SVM, MLP and CNN.

Concurrently, freshwater overexploitation in agriculture, especially in arid and water-scarce areas, emphasises the vital role of appropriate water-saving irrigations techniques to ensure natural resources sustainability in food supply networks. In line with the development of automated systems, the use of sensors for water monitoring, indicatively in the cases of smart farming or precision agriculture, could further promote the preservation of freshwater resources. To this end, this research first provides a review of sensor applications for improving sustainability in agrifood systems. We then focus on digital technologies applied for monitoring and assessing freshwater utilisation in the food commodities sector based on academic literature and real-world business evidence. A contextual map is developed for capturing the main technical, environmental and economic factors affecting the selection of sensors for water monitoring and stewardship during agricultural production.

Conventional soil survey and cartography methods on a macroscopic scale based on grids with a coarse resolution are inadequate for the rapid development of precision agriculture. The demand for soil mapping content and accuracy has increased as more convenient methods of acquiring multi-source geo-spatial data have been developed, and such data are commonly employed to extract basic mapping units and environmental variables in related algorithms. We employ geo-objects as basic units of soil property mapping, which are extracted from high-resolution remote sensing images using a convolutional neural network based learning algorithm. Multi-source geo-spatial data are transferred into each geo-object as environmental variables, and the relationships between soil properties and environmental variables are mined using powerful tree-based machine learning algorithms, including regressions with random forests and XGBoost. A data set that includes soil sample points and multi-source geo-spatial data is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the method allows for better soil organic matter mapping than state-of-the-art interpolation-based and linear-regression-based methods. The proposed procedure has potential to be a general method for mapping other soil properties. Its advantages are embodied in the modeling of relatively miscellaneous data with implicitly associated non-linear relationships between soil properties and environmental variables. The spatial scale and accuracy of the finer maps capture more detailed characteristics of the soil properties and are applicable to the micro-domain fields required for refined soil mapping with small variations.",2019,26,0,10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2902375,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8ea5948e7f52799dffb23e4aeac9cb048f80335,"JournalArticle,Review",IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing

Precision agriculture is also contributing to the inter and intra crop monitoring. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles are used widely for acquiring images. In this paper, we purpose Clifford geometric algebra to enhance the segmented images acquired from the UAVs of different agricultural fields. The Clifford geometric algebra is also sometimes used as a collective term for the diverse range of mathematical fields, both classical and modern algebraic mathematics. Previous image segmentation approaches depend upon the intensity of red, green, and blue colors; but the complete perspective could not be obtained from these approaches. Geometric algebra overcomes this limitation and leads to a genuine color space image processing. It is mainly used in the processing of medical images. Subalgebra of the Clifford algebra is Quaternions. We have used this approach in agricultural images.

DSSAT применяется для моделирования развития биомассы и прогнозирования урожая 42 сельскохозяйственных культур с учетом почвенных и климатических условий и метеорологических особенностей конкретного года. На основе результатов агроэкологического мониторинга посева озимой пшеницы (Triticum aestivum L.) сорта Звезда линия 1 - уникального гибрида, полученного методом отдаленной гибридизации с пыреем средним (Elytrigia intermedia (Host) Nevski) на дерново-подзолистых почвах Центра Точного Земледелия РГАУ-МСХА имени К.А. Тимирязева проведены настройка и тестирование модели CERES-Wheat, входящей в DSSAT v 4.6 CSM. Для настройки модели использовалась информация о почве, агротехнологическим мероприятиям, системе применения удобрений, климатическим условиям, а также характеристикам развития биомассы озимой пшеницы за 2015-2016 гг. После настройки смоделированные даты фенологических фаз отличались от реальных на 2-3 дня, а урожай - на 5%. В результате были получены оценки для так называемых «генетических» коэффициентов, характеризующих развитие сорта в конкретных почвенно-климатических условиях и при применяемых агротехнологиях. Рассчитанные коэффициенты оказались близки к полученным для Восточной Европы и Великобритании. В результате тестирования модели по данным вегетационного сезона 2016-2017 гг., более холодного по метеорологическим условиям, отклонение смоделированного урожая от реально полученного составило 31% в сторону уменьшения. В целом проведенное исследование показало потенциальную возможность настройки модели CERES-Wheat системы DSSAT для моделирования озимой пшеницы в условиях Московской области.
 The paper presents the first in Russia experience of using DSSAT (the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) that is the world’s most widespread system for supporting and making agrotechnological decisions. It is used to simulate the biomass development and to predict the yield of 42 crops at a certain location taking into account the meteorological conditions of a particular year. The CERES-Wheat model based on the DSSAT v 4.6 CSM was adapted and tested using the results of agro-ecological monitoring of the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) variety Zvezda, line 1, the unique hybrid obtained by the method of distant hybridization with wheatgrass medium (Elytrigia intermedia (Host) Nevski), planted on soddy-podzolic soils of the Precision Agriculture Center of the Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy. Information about the soil, agricultural technology interventions, the system of fertilizer application and climatic conditions as well as the characteristics of winter wheat biomass development 2015-2016 was introduced into the system for the model adaptation. After that the simulated dates of phenological phases differed from the real ones by 2-3 days, and the harvest - by 5%. As a result, the so-called “genetic” coefficients characterizing the development of a particular variety in climatic conditions on a specific field with the applied agricultural technologies were estimated. The estimated values of the coefficients were close to those ones for Eastern Europe and the United Kingdom. Testing the model to the data of the growing season 2016-2017, colder in meteorological conditions, showed the deviation of the modeled yield from the actual yield by 31% downward. In general, the study showed the potential possibility to customize the CERES-Wheat model of the DSSAT to winter wheat simulations in the conditions of the Moscow region.",2019,0,0,10.26178/ae.2019.64.37.006,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05603f1a5d20db1dc50186e1121d0c7bf92be4d7,JournalArticle,ПРОБЛЕМЫ АГРОХИМИИ И ЭКОЛОГИИ

Therefore, estimation of node location is a legitimate problem in WSNs, due to the fact that uncovered region can result in coverage-holes in the network. One state-of-art solution of this problem is Global Positioning System (GPS) but GPS based solution to localize a node might not be worthy due to the cost of extra hardware and power requirements. Therefore, a low cost solution to this problem might be Computational Geometry based approach to localize a node. In this paper, we first find out distance between Anchor Node (AN) and Unknown Node (UN) based on RSSI Profiling. Subsequently, the node location is estimated using Trilateration. Finally, a Delaunay Triangle is constructed on the basis of node location information. Then the property of empty circle is used to recognize whether coverage hole is present or not in the given ROI.

e065169f7202398a5da6d70bcb92a3e168536ff8,A Non-Reference Temperature Histogram Method for Determining Tc from Ground-Based Thermal Imagery of Orchard Tree Canopies,"Obtaining average canopy temperature (Tc) by thresholding canopy pixels from on-ground thermal imagery has historically been undertaken using ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ reference surfaces in the field (reference temperature thresholding). However, this method is extremely time inefficient and can suffer inaccuracies if the surfaces are non-standardised or unable to stabilise with the environment. The research presented in this paper evaluates non-reference techniques to obtain average canopy temperature (Tc) from thermal imagery of avocado trees, both for the shaded side and sunlit side, without the need of reference temperature values. A sample of 510 thermal images (from 130 avocado trees) were acquired with a FLIR B250 handheld thermal imaging camera. Two methods based on temperature histograms were evaluated for removing non-canopy-related pixel information from the analysis, enabling Tc to be determined. These approaches included: 1) Histogram gradient thresholding based on temperature intensity changes (HG); and 2) histogram thresholding at one or more standard deviation (SD) above and below the mean. The HG method was found to be more accurate (R2 > 0.95) than the SD method in defining canopy pixels and calculating Tc from each thermal image (shaded and sunlit) when compared to the standard reference temperature thresholding method. The results from this study present an alternative non-reference method for determining Tc from ground-based thermal imagery without the need of calibration surfaces. As such, it offers a more efficient and computationally autonomous method that will ultimately support the greater adoption of non-invasive thermal technologies within a precision agricultural system.",2019,12,0,10.3390/RS11060714,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e065169f7202398a5da6d70bcb92a3e168536ff8,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

In this study, we discussed the use of lightweight UAV with dual image-frame snapshot cameras to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) and panicle biomass (PB) of rice at different growth stages with different nitrogen (N) treatments. The spatial–temporal variations in the typical vegetation indices (VIs) and AGB were first investigated, and the accuracy of crop surface model (CSM) extracted from the Red Green Blue (RGB) images at two different stages were also evaluated. Random forest (RF) model for AGB estimation as well as the PB was then developed. Furthermore, variable importance and sensitivity analysis of UAV variables were performed to study the potential of improving model robustness and prediction accuracies. It was found that the canopy height extracted from the CSM (Hcsm) exhibited a high correlation with the ground-measured canopy height, while it was unsuitable to be independently used for biomass assessment of rice during the entire growth stages. We also observed that several VIs were highly correlated with AGB, and the modified normalized difference spectral index extracted from the multispectral image achieved the highest correlation. RF model with fusing RGB and multispectral image data substantially improved the prediction results of AGB and PB with the prediction of root mean square error (RMSEP) reduced by 8.33–16.00%. The best prediction results for AGB and PB were achieved with the coefficient of determination (r2), the RMSEP and relative RMSE (RRMSE) of 0.90, 0.21 kg/m2 and 14.05%, and 0.68, 0.10 kg/m2 and 12.11%, respectively. In addition, the result confirmed that the sensitivity analysis could simplify the prediction model without reducing the prediction accuracy. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of applying lightweight UAV with dual image-frame snapshot cameras for rice biomass estimation, and its potential for high throughput analysis of plant growth-related traits in precision agriculture as well as the advanced breeding program.",2019,134,9,10.1186/s13007-019-0418-8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/be73cd6e6534316b51a089e39e11ca0da8bfd637,JournalArticle,Plant Methods

Deep‐learning approaches have recently achieved both excellent classification performance and real‐time execution. However, these techniques also rely on a large amount of training data, requiring a substantial labeling effort, both of which are scarce in precision agriculture. Additional design efforts are required to achieve commercially viable performance levels under varying environmental conditions and crop growth stages. In this paper, we explore the role of knowledge transfer between deep‐learning‐based classifiers for different crop types, with the goal of reducing the retraining time and labeling efforts required for a new crop. We examine the classification performance on three datasets with different crop types and containing a variety of weeds and compare the performance and retraining efforts required when using data labeled at pixel level with partially labeled data obtained through a less time‐consuming procedure of annotating the segmentation output. We show that transfer learning between different crop types is possible and reduces training times for up to 80%. Furthermore, we show that even when the data used for retraining are imperfectly annotated, the classification performance is within 2% of that of networks trained with laboriously annotated pixel‐precision data.",2019,141,3,10.1002/rob.21869,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/053a03dad97cf7c3545ab1bfb363df343a59dba3,JournalArticle,J.

Sources A comprehensive literature search was conducted on the current state of knowledge of water buffalo published in high-quality peer-reviewed journals. The search revealed important progress in generation of knowledge about uses, economically important traits, challenges, and science-based solutions of water buffalo. Molecular determinants of key economically important traits such as longevity, disease resistance, milk production and quality, meat production and quality, growth and development, heat stress, and fertility are deciphered. Synthesis Water buffalo are important sources of food and fiber for the ever-increasing global human population. Drought-adapted water buffalo provide meat, and highly nutritious milk used to make cream, butter, yogurt, and cheese. Despite valuable contributions to agriculture and human well-being, there are current and emerging challenges and opportunities. High resolution sequencing of breeds and comprehensive annotation of the genomes are not yet available. In addition, there is a lack of fundamental knowledge about economically important traits including longevity, disease resistance, milk production and quality, meat production and quality, growth and development, heat tolerance, and fertility. With the advances in both basic science and technology, the gaps in the knowledge in these areas can be tackled with innovative research and systems biology approaches. In addition, the power of comparative animal and functional genomics can be harnessed to fill in the gaps. The core elements of sustainable solutions include education, innovative, transformative and translational research, and technology transfer. Conclusions and Applications Knowledge about the fundamental biology of water buffalo gives the power to improve sustainable, efficient, and profitable production. Although a considerable amount of information is available, providing new knowledge about the economically important traits will enable precision farming in water buffalo agriculture. New data and knowledge generated through the genome to phenome will uncover essential molecular, cellular, and physiological markers for marker-assisted selection and breeding to enhance the efficiency of reproduction and production as well as product quality. Future studies using systems physiology approaches will advance the science and technology for water buffalo. These new frontiers are important for empowering the next generation of animal scientists and the public as well as for food security on the global scale.",2019,39,0,10.15232/AAS.2018-01810,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ca6029fba3c21840652808ca5c8760f39f76216,Review,Applied Animal Science

A rapid and simultaneous analytical method for 260 pesticides in human urine was developed and validated using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). High speed positive/negative switching electrospray ionization (ESI) mode was used, and scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was optimized. Three versions of scaled-down QuEChERS procedures were evaluated, and the procedure using non-buffer reagents (magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride) and excluding cleanup steps was selected for optimum pesticide extraction. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) in this methodology was 10 ng/mL for each target pesticide, and correlation coefficient (r2) values of calibration curves were ≥0.988 (linearity range; 10–250 ng/mL). In accuracy and precision tests, the relative error ranges were −18.4% to 19.5%, with relative standard deviation (RSD) 2.1%–19.9% at an LOQ level (10 ng/mL), and −14.7% to 14.9% (RSD; 0.6%–14.9%) at higher concentrations (50, 150, and 250 ng/mL). Recovery range was 54.2%–113.9% (RSD; 0.3%–20.0%), and the soft matrix effect (range; −20% to 20%) was observed in 75.4% of target pesticides.

73fc2a6ccbeb8d23f6eea4b001ed6bf813705626,Analytics in sustainable precision animal nutrition,"The global population, resource, and climate dynamics suggest we must improve sustainability of food production systems (Ohlsson, 2014; Kleinman et al., 2018). Improving livestock production sustainability is particularly important because a significant portion of the projected increases in global food demand is anticipated to come from livestock (Thornton, 2010). Improving sustainability of livestock production systems can be achieved through optimized reproductive, genetic, nutritional, and health management (White et al., 2014, 2015). Management decisions within livestock production can be thought of as two interleaved feedback loops. The first feedback loop is between the animal and the environment: the animal is influenced by its environment and, in turn, influences its environment. The second feedback loop is between the animal and the manager: the manager takes information about the animal’s behavior and attempts to influence the environment to optimize the animal’s performance (Figure 1). Managers make management decisions on different timescales ranging from immediate to relaxed. An example of an immediate management decision would be a farmer identifying an animal as sick, isolating the animal, and treating the animal for the illness. We term this immediate because the farmer must identify the sick animal as soon as possible and must react to the diagnosis as soon as possible. An example of a relaxed management decision would be the farmer electing to change the feed provided to his animals in response to something observed about their production (i.e., the cows are producing poorly, so change the ration to provide higher nutrient density to correct a nutrient shortfall). This decision is more relaxed because its formulation and response are subjected to natural, biological delays (i.e., it may take days to weeks to see a production response to a new diet). Improving the precision of these decision-making processes and reducing the burden of decision making on farmers are two critical steps toward improving sustainability of livestock production. Precision agricultural technologies have been identified as one possible solution (Berckmans, 2014; Tullo et al., 2019).

The devices are designed using the ultra-low power nRF52840 microcontroller with Bluetooth 5 support and ambient energy harvesting. A power of 942µW is harvested in an indoor environment. The devices are therefore suitable for both indoor and outdoor use, as natural sunlight will provide far more energy compared to artificial indoor lights. A line-of-sight range of up to 1.8km is achieved with the use of coded transmissions. However, the coverage area and range can be extended significantly by deploying the devices in multi-hop network topology. The custom multi-hop protocol provides energy efficient communication from any device in a wireless sensor network to a gateway while consuming an average of 267µW with a transmission interval of 5 minutes.

The above said Multi-SVM algorithm are models that are either supervised by human or robot which, when fed with the essential data makes segmentation and classification of the types of illness. The Image processing is been implemented to get the capture of leaves at significant stages. This Multi-SVM when compared over the Convolutional Neural Networks has several advantages. While the Multi-SVM is global and unique, the Convolutional neural network suffers from multiple local minima.

Autonomous monitoring, pruning, spraying and harvesting are some of these agricultural tasks, which requires an advanced path planning system aware of maximum robot capabilities (mobile platform and arms), terrain slopes and plant/fruits position. The state of the art path planning systems have two limitations: are not optimized for large regions and the path planning is not aware of agricultural tasks requirements. This work presents two solutions to overcome these limitations. It considers the VGR2TO (Vineyard Grid Map to Topological) approach to extract from a 2D grid map a topological map, to reduce the total amount of memory needed by the path planning algorithm and to reduce path search space.

c605022150f75afa1cea067dd798a11f7a3ad9ac,A 10-nm Spectral Resolution Hyperspectral LiDAR System Based on an Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter,"Hyperspectral LiDAR (HSL) technology can obtain spectral and ranging information from targets by processing the recorded waveforms and measuring the time of flight (ToF). With the development of the supercontinuum laser (SCL), it is technically easier to develop an active hyperspectral LiDAR system that can simultaneously collect both spatial information and extensive spectral information from targets. Compared with traditional LiDAR technology, which can only obtain range and intensity information at the selected spectral wavelengths, HSL detection technology has demonstrated its potential and adaptability for various quantitative applications from its spectrally resolved waveforms. However, with most previous HSLs, the collected spectral information is discrete, and such information might be insufficient and restrict the further applicability of the HSLs. In this paper, a tunable HSL technology using an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) as a spectroscopic device was proposed, designed, and tested to address this issue. Both the general range precision and the accuracy of the spectral measurement were evaluated. By tuning the spectroscopic device in the time dimension, the proposed AOTF-HSL could achieve backscattered echo with continuous coverage of the full spectrum of 500–1000 nm, which had the unique characteristics of a continuous spectrum in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) regions with 10 nm spectral resolution. Yellow and green leaves from four plants (aloe, dracaena, balata, and radermachera) were measured using the AOTF-HSL to assess its feasibility in agriculture application. The spectral profiles measured by a standard spectrometer (SVC© HR-1024) were used as a reference for evaluating the measurements of the AOTF-HSL. The difference between the spectral measurements collected from active and passive instruments was minor. The comparison results show that the AOTF-based consecutive and high spectral resolution HSL was effective for this application.",2019,61,0,10.3390/s19071620,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c605022150f75afa1cea067dd798a11f7a3ad9ac,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

Precipitation is one of the most important parameters of the earth’s system, and its global distribution and changes are essential data for modeling the water cycle, maintaining ecosystems, increasing agricultural production, improving weather forecasting precision, and implementing flood warning systems. In the Global Precipitation Measurement project, integrated products of high-resolution mapping of precipitation, obtained from microwave measurements made by a constellation satellite and infrared radiometers in geostationary orbit, are developed and supplied to the public. However, these high-resolution products, such as GSMaP_MVK, sometimes underestimate surface precipitation, introducing large errors into hydrological modeling.

Laboratory incubation experiments reveal that biological N2 production, whether by denitrification or anaerobic ammonia oxidation, yields proportions of 15N15N in N2 that are within 1‰ of that predicted for a random distribution of 15N and 14N atoms. This relatively invariant isotopic signature contrasts with that of the atmosphere, which has 15N15N proportions in excess of the random distribution by 19.1 ± 0.1‰. Depth profiles of gases in agricultural soils from the Kellogg Biological Station Long-Term Ecological Research site show biological N2 accumulation that accounts for up to 1.6% of the soil N2.

This paper proposes a region-based end-to-end approach named PestNet for large-scale multi-class pest detection and classification based on deep learning. PestNet consists of three major parts. First, a novel module channel–spatial attention (CSA) is proposed to be fused into the convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone for feature extraction and enhancement. The second one is called region proposal network (RPN) that is adopted for providing region proposals as potential pest positions based on extracted feature maps from images. Position-sensitive score map (PSSM), the third component, is used to replace fully connected (FC) layers for pest classification and bounding box regression. Furthermore, we apply contextual regions of interest (RoIs) as contextual information of pest features to improve detection accuracy.

This paper describes the implementation of a wireless visual sensor network for precision agriculture to monitor paddy crop for weeds using Raspberry Pi. Bluetooth 4.0 was used by visual sensor nodes to send the data to the base station. Base station forwarded the data to the remote station using IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n standard. The solar cell battery was used to power up the sensor nodes and the base station. At the remote station, images were preprocessed to remove soil background and different shape features were extracted. Random forest and support vector machine classifiers were used to classify the paddy crop and weed based on the shape features. The results and observations obtained from the experimental setup of the system in a small paddy field are also reported. This system could be expected to enhance the crop production by giving timely advice to the crop producers about the presence of weeds so that steps can be taken to eradicate weeds.",2019,72,3,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2908846,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a52733321ae6a07cb9dc18c5adc9bd2e00c34073,JournalArticle,IEEE Access

e25f01bed5ad7e9275e0a95ce6eac39742014011,Research on Vision-Based Navigation for Plant Protection UAV under the Near Color Background,"GPS (Global Positioning System) navigation in agriculture is facing many challenges, such as weak signals in orchards and the high cost for small plots of farmland. With the reduction of camera cost and the emergence of excellent visual algorithms, visual navigation can solve the above problems. Visual navigation is a navigation technology that uses cameras to sense environmental information as the basis of an aircraft flight. It is mainly divided into five parts: Image acquisition, landmark recognition, route planning, flight control, and obstacle avoidance. Here, landmarks are plant canopy, buildings, mountains, and rivers, with unique geographical characteristics in a place. During visual navigation, landmark location and route tracking are key links. When there are significant color-differences (for example, the differences among red, green, and blue) between a landmark and the background, the landmark can be recognized based on classical visual algorithms. However, in the case of non-significant color-differences (for example, the differences between dark green and vivid green) between a landmark and the background, there are no robust and high-precision methods for landmark identification. In view of the above problem, visual navigation in a maize field is studied. First, the block recognition method based on fine-tuned Inception-V3 is developed; then, the maize canopy landmark is recognized based on the above method; finally, local navigation lines are extracted from the landmarks based on the maize canopy grayscale gradient law. The results show that the accuracy is 0.9501. When the block number is 256, the block recognition method achieves the best segmentation. The average segmentation quality is 0.87, and time is 0.251 s. This study suggests that stable visual semantic navigation can be achieved under the near color background. It will be an important reference for the navigation of plant protection UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle).",2019,11,1,10.3390/SYM11040533,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e25f01bed5ad7e9275e0a95ce6eac39742014011,JournalArticle,Symmetry
3e6d7ca07208646e375f46066935150f5d5eb08e,On the feasibility of estimating soluble sugar content using millimeter-wave,"With the development of novel sensing techniques, continuous monitoring, data-driven inferences, precision irrigation control, and intelligent Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, agriculture sector is witnessing a revolution. Specialized devices based on infrared and laser are developed to assist farmers in assessing the produce quality, especially its sugar content. However, such devices are expensive and not readily available to consumers. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using 60 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) signal as a ubiquitous and non-invasive way to estimate the Soluble Sugar Content (SSC) in fruits. With the rapid development in the mmWave technology, 60 GHz WiFi is likely to become pervasive in future mobile devices. Our study shows that when 60 GHz WiFi signals reflect from a fruit, the reflection can be used to infer the fruit's sugar content. We identify the underlying reasons of variations in reflection signals with varying SSC and study the impact of size, shape and density of fruits on reflections. We then develop statistical features based on received signal strength and amplitude, and use them to design regression-based estimation models. With an extensive evaluation with 300 fruit samples, we find that our proposed technique can estimate SSC in three different type of fruits with an average correlation coefficient of 85%. Our prediction errors are within the range of user's taste perception.",2019,16,4,10.1145/3302505.3310065,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e6d7ca07208646e375f46066935150f5d5eb08e,"Book,JournalArticle",International Conference on Internet-of-Things Design and Implementation

a42f0a1c1fa66d3b3e2a4daaa40b1f34833a30e7,Facing Climate Change: Biotechnology of Iconic Mediterranean Woody Crops,"The Mediterranean basin is especially sensitive to the adverse outcomes of climate change and especially to variations in rainfall patterns and the incidence of extremely high temperatures. These two concurring adverse environmental conditions will surely have a detrimental effect on crop performance and productivity that will be particularly severe on woody crops such as citrus, olive and grapevine that define the backbone of traditional Mediterranean agriculture. These woody species have been traditionally selected for traits such as improved fruit yield and quality or alteration in harvesting periods, leaving out traits related to plant field performance. This is currently a crucial aspect due to the progressive and imminent effects of global climate change. Although complete genome sequence exists for sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and clementine (Citrus clementina), olive tree (Olea europaea) and grapevine (Vitis vinifera), the development of biotechnological tools to improve stress tolerance still relies on the study of the available genetic resources including interspecific hybrids, naturally occurring (or induced) polyploids and wild relatives under field conditions. To this respect, post-genomic era studies including transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics provide a wide and unbiased view of plant physiology and biochemistry under adverse environmental conditions that, along with high-throughput phenotyping, could contribute to the characterization of plant genotypes exhibiting physiological and/or genetic traits that are correlated to abiotic stress tolerance. The ultimate goal of precision agriculture is to improve crop productivity, in terms of yield and quality, making a sustainable use of land and water resources under adverse environmental conditions using all available biotechnological tools and high-throughput phenotyping. This review focuses on the current state-of-the-art of biotechnological tools such as high throughput –omics and phenotyping on grapevine, citrus and olive and their contribution to plant breeding programs.",2019,78,0,10.3389/fpls.2019.00427,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a42f0a1c1fa66d3b3e2a4daaa40b1f34833a30e7,"Review,JournalArticle",Frontiers in Plant Science

Training such networks on graphics processing units (GPUs) currently offers unmatched levels of performance; however, GPUs are subject to large-power requirements. With recent advancements in high-level synthesis (HLS) techniques, new methods for accelerating deep networks using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are emerging. FPGA-based DNNs present substantial advantages in energy efficiency over conventional CPU- and GPU-accelerated networks. Using the Intel FPGA software development kit (SDK) for OpenCL development environment, networks described using the high-level OpenCL framework can be accelerated targeting heterogeneous platforms including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. These networks, if properly customized on GPUs and FPGAs, can be ideal candidates for learning and inference in resource-constrained portable devices such as robots and the Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices, where power is limited and performance is critical. Here, we introduce GPU- and FPGA-accelerated deterministically binarized DNNs, tailored toward weed species classification for robotic weed control. Our developed networks are trained and benchmarked using a publicly available weed species dataset, named DeepWeeds, which include close to 18 000 weed images. We demonstrate that our FPGA-accelerated binarized networks significantly outperform their GPU-accelerated counterparts, achieving a>7-fold decrease in power consumption, while performing inference on weed images 2.86 times faster compared to our best performing baseline full-precision GPU implementation. These significant benefits are gained whilst losing only 1.17% of validation accuracy. In this paper, this is a significant step toward enabling deep inference and learning on IoT edge devices, and smart portable machines such as agricultural robots, which is the target application.",2019,70,5,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2911709,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31f0b284a278c3a976482d61ddb666f79c0293f5,JournalArticle,IEEE Access

Out of these methods, seed drill and pneumatic planting methods are more precise. Seed singulation capability of pneumatic planter is higher however it requires more energy. Seed drilling is most common method for cereals and pulse crops. In seed drill different type of metering mechanism are used for seed singulation. The seed drills are modified with seed metering mechanism for more precise singulation. These machines are called planter. Different types of seed mechanism are used for singulation in planter. These are variable orifice, fluted roller, internal double run, inclined plate and cup feed type. These mechanisms generally require ground wheel for transmission of the power. Due to load on ground wheel for power transmission to metering mechanism, the ground wheel skidding is observed. This skidding is responsible for non-uniform seed placement.

The objective of the present work is to quantify the impact of the pest Jacobiasca lybica on vineyards and to develop representative cartography of the severity of the infestation. To accomplish this work, computational vision algorithms based on an ANN (artificial neural network) combined with geometric techniques were applied to geomatic products using consumer-grade cameras in the visible spectra. The results showed that the combination of geometric and computational vision techniques with geomatic products generated from conventional RGB (red, green, blue) images improved image segmentation of the affected vegetation, healthy vegetation and ground. Thus, the proposed methodology using low-cost cameras is a more cost-effective application of UAVs compared with multispectral cameras.

Undoubtedly, our era is characterized by the mass production of huge amounts of data, information and content deriving from many different sources, mostly IoT devices and sensors, but also from environmentalists, agronomists, winemakers, or plain farmers and interested stakeholders themselves. Being an emerging field, only a small part of this rich content has been aggregated so far in digital platforms that serve as cross-domain hubs. The latter offer typically limited usability and accessibility of the actual content itself due to problems dealing with insufficient data and metadata availability, as well as their quality.

Human activities, e.g. the agricultural use of mineral fertilizers, accelerate nitrogen transformations, leading to higher emissions of this strong greenhouse gas. Investigating the stable isotopic composition of N₂O provides a better understanding of formation mechanisms to disentangle its variable source and sink processes. Mid-infrared (mid-IR) laser spectroscopy is a highly attractive technique to analyze N₂O isotopocules based on their specific ro-vibrational absorption characteristics. Specifically, quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS) in combination with preconcentration has shown to be powerful for simultaneous and high-precision analysis of the main N₂O isotopocules. Recently, in the scope of my PhD project, we have been advancing this analytical technique for the analysis of the very rare doubly substituted N₂O isotopic species 15N14N18O, 14N15N18O, and 15N15N16O, also known as clumped isotopes.

Automation of agricultural machinery is aimed at solving specific practical tasks: control and maintenance of the technological process quality, increasing labor productivity as well as crop yields. The method of ""precision farming"" is economically expedient, since it is a direct saving of technological material, as well as it helps reducing the negative impact on the environment and farm produce. (Research purpose) The research purpose is to review and analyze the main aspects required to develop the algorithms and software for motion control systems for a robotic tillage unit. (Materials and methods) To implement process control, it is necessary to control the direction of travel along a specified path, change the speed of movement depending on the engine load, switching the transmission gears. Physical-and-mechanical characteristics of the unit are rather heterogeneous and depend on weather conditions. Therefore, the algorithm for controlling the power of the robotic mobile unit must take into account, as much as possible, variations in the external effects of drawbar properties and the motion resistance, as a random factor. (Results and discussion) The authors have developed an imitation model representing the movement of a robotic unit. For the simulation, use has been made of a cyclic trajectory of the unit movement, consisting of two types of sections: the rectilinear ones reflecting the soil tillage pattern, and the turn areas where the unit makes a turn along a curvilinear trajectory around a certain center. (Conclusions) The implementation of robotic technologies in agricultural production result in increased technical, technological, production and economic indicators of agricultural units in field work, increased labor productivity, reduced time required for fieldworks, more rational use of bioenergy resources, increased yields of agricultural crops and reduced environmental impacts.",2019,3,0,10.22314/2073-7599-2018-12-6-48-52,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/834773c5812a7e481abaae338d330ea996197b30,Review,Agricultural Machinery and Technologies

Although boundaries of environmental parameters that should be maintained are well studied, fine-tuning can significantly improve the efficiency, which is infeasible to be done manually due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space. Traditionally seed germination is performed in climatic chambers with controlled environmental conditions. In this study, we perform a set of multiple-day seed germination experiments in the controllable environment. We use up to three climatic chambers to adjust humidity, temperature, water supply and apply machine learning algorithm called Bayesian optimization (BO) to find the parameters that improve seed germination. Experimental results show that our approach allows to increase the germination efficiency for different types of seeds compared to the initial expert knowledge-based guess. Our experiments demonstrated that BO could help to identify the values of the controllable parameters that increase seed germination efficiency. The proposed methodology is model-free, and we argue that it may be useful for a variety of optimization problems in precision agriculture.

Agriculture, due to its economic and social impact on the global population, arises as a potential domain which could enormously benefit from this paradigm in terms of savings in time, resources and human labor, not to mention aspects related to sustainability and environment respect. This has led to a new revolution named precision agriculture (or precision farming), based on observing and measuring inter and intra-field variability in crops. A key technology in this scenario is the use of hyperspectral imaging, firstly used in satellites and later in manned aircraft, composed by hundreds of spectral bands which facilitate hidden data to be converted into useful information. In this paper, a hyperspectral flying platform is presented and the construction of the whole system is detailed. The proposed solution is based on a commercial DJI Matrice 600 drone and a Specim FX10 hyperspectral camera. The challenge in this work has been to adopt this latter device, mainly conceived for industrial applications, into a flying platform in which weight, power budget, and connectivity are paramount. Additionally, an embedded board with advanced processing capabilities has been mounted on the drone in order to control its trajectory, manage the data acquisition, and allow on-board processing, such as the evaluation of different vegetation indices (the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, the modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index, MCARI, and the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, MSAVI), which are numerical and/or graphical indicators of the vegetation properties and compression, which is of crucial relevance due to the huge amounts of data captured.

Besides the imagery acquisition, canopy segmentation among soil, plants and shadows is another practical and technical aspect that must be fast and precise to ensure a targeted intervention. In this paper, algorithms to be applied to UAV imagery are proposed according to the sensor used that could either be visible spectral or multispectral. These algorithms, called HSV-based (Hue, Saturation, Value), DEM (Digital Elevation Model) and K-means, are unsupervised, i.e., they perform canopy segmentation without human support. They were tested and compared in three different scenarios obtained from two vineyards over two years, 2017 and 2018 for RGB (Red-Green-Blue) and NRG (Near Infrared-Red-Green) imagery. Particular attention is given to the unsupervised ability of these algorithms to identify vines in these different acquisition conditions. This ability is quantified by the introduction of over- and under- estimation indexes, which are the algorithm’s ability to over-estimate or under-estimate vine canopies. For RGB imagery, the HSV-based algorithms consistently over-estimate vines, and never under-estimate them. The k-means and DEM method have a similar trend of under-estimation. While for NRG imagery, the HSV is the more stable algorithm and the DEM model slightly over-estimates the vines. HSV-based algorithms and the DEM algorithm have comparable computation time. The k-means algorithm increases computational demand as the quality of the DEM decreases. The algorithms developed can isolate canopy vegetation data, which is useful information about the current vineyard state, and can be used as a tool to be efficiently applied in the crop management procedure within precision viticulture applications.",2019,48,1,10.3390/RS11091023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5eb999ef60a9425c9e48931730173f7800870448,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

The vector tracking (VT) technique is promising to enhance the robustness in highdynamics as well as improve the sensitivity against the weak environment of the GNSS receiver.However, the time-correlated error coupled in the receiver clock estimations in terms of the VT loopcan decrease the accuracy of the navigation solution. There are few works present dealing with thisissue. In this work, the Allan variance is accordingly exploited to specify a model which is expectedto account for this type of error based on the 1st-order Gauss-Markov (GM) process. Then, it is usedfor proposing an enhanced Kalman filter (KF) by which this error can be suppressed. Furthermore,the proposed system model makes use of the innovation sequence so that the process covariancematrix can be adaptively adjusted and updated. The field tests demonstrate the performance of theproposed adaptive vector-tracking time-correlated error suppressed Kalman filter (A-VTTCES-KF).When compared with the results produced by the ordinary adaptive KF algorithm in terms of the VTloop, the real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning and code-based differential global positioning system(DGPS) positioning accuracies have been improved by 14.17% and 9.73%, respectively. On the otherhand, the RTK positioning performance has been increased by maximum 21.40% when comparedwith the results obtained from the commercial low-cost U-Blox receiver.",2019,14,0,10.3390/RS11091026,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f1a0fd5b9895840be5e278a5d76679542db81412,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

Real-time data from agriculture sensors can provide decision supports to improve the yields and quality of agricultural products, but also bring about challenges one of which is how to mine useful information from these vast amounts of data at acceptable computation costs. To deal with the dimension disaster problem faced by most conventional mining algorithms, in this paper we combine granulation techniques and genetic algorithm (GA) with a support vector machine (SVM) to propose a granular GA-SVM. In the integrated predictor, three granulation methods, that is, Min–Median–Max granulation, Quartile–Median granulation, and fuzzy granulation, are introduced to break down big data in agricultural cyber-physical systems into small-scale granules, and GA is used to find the optimal values of SVM penalty parameter and kernel parameter from the reduced granules. Internet of Things (IoT) data from Luochuan Apple Experimental Demonstration Station in Shaanxi Province, China, verified that the proposed granular GA-SVM predictor is effective to make big data prediction with reduced computation time and equivalent accuracy.

However, the quality of optical images would influenced by cloud. Radar is known to be very sensitive to vegetation physiognomy and biomass. The sensitivity of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to the structural features of terrain leads to landcover classification into simple and easily interpreted structural classes.

The spatial constraints due to topographical or some other adverse conditions may restrict both the location of sensor nodes and cluster heads inside well defined planar regions within the WSN, while some other regions may be more amenable for easy deployment of sensors nodes and cluster heads. A new method of determining the optimum number of balanced clusters and the locations of the cluster heads in a Wireless Sensor Network with spatial constraints is presented. The optimum number of balanced clusters is determined using an iterative approach. The K-means clustering algorithm is modified to obtain balanced clusters. The cluster head locations are determined using the constrained nonlinear convex optimal solver based on ‘pattern search’ technique. In our scheme, the cluster heads are not elected from the cluster members. Instead, higher capacity communication nodes are placed at the optimal locations obtained by the optimal solver. Silhouette simulation result shows lesser the indices better the quality.

The purpose of this work was to develop an autonomous mobile platform with soil sampling device for agriculture. Soil samples are analysed to determine the composition, characteristics or nutrient levels of the soil. Smallholder farmers can use simple hand-held field-testing kits.

A recently proposed non-myopic planning algorithm, Decentralised Monte Carlo tree search, is used to coordinate the actions of the robot arms. Motion planning is performed over a navigation graph that considers the high-dimensional configuration space of the robot arms. Extensive simulated experiments are carried out using real sensor data and then validated on hardware with two robot arms. Our proposed targeted information gain planner is compared to state-of-the-art baselines and outperforms them in every measured metric. The robots quickly observe and accurately detect fruit in a trellis structure, demonstrating the viability of the approach for real-world applications.",2019,39,1,10.1109/ICRA.2019.8793560,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f3cdbd72dd0a3f0204b38e3d544aa09a5f506a33,"JournalArticle,Conference",IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation

A large amount of data collected by these sensors may provide essential information for precision or site-specific management in a production field. Data clustering techniques are crucial for data mining, and high-density data analysis is important for field management. A new clustering technique was introduced and compared with existing clustering tools to determine the relatively homogeneous parts of agricultural fields. A DUALEM-21S sensor, along with high-accuracy topography data, was used to characterize soil variability in three agricultural fields situated in Ontario, Canada. Sentinel-2 data assisted in quantifying bare soil and vegetation indices (VIs). The custom Neighborhood Search Analyst (NSA) data clustering tool was implemented using Python scripts. In this algorithm, part of the variance of each data layer is accounted for by subdividing the field into smaller, relatively homogeneous, areas. The algorithm’s attributes were illustrated using field elevation, shallow and deep apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), and several VIs. The unique feature of this proposed protocol was the successful development of user-friendly and open source options for defining the spatial continuity of each group and for use in the zone delineation process.",2019,14,1,10.3390/RS11091036,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff42091987a6b9a8b5b02d6aff4bde798522f552,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

Agricultural robots can accelerate plant breeding and advance data-driven precision farming with significantly reduced labor inputs by providing task-appropriate sensing and actuation at fine spatiotemporal resolutions. This article highlights the distinctive challenges imposed on ground robots by agricultural environments, which are characterized by wide variations in environmental conditions, diversity and complexity of plant canopy structures, and intraspecies biological variation of physical and chemical characteristics and responses to the environment. Existing approaches to address these challenges are presented, along with their limitations; possible future directions are also discussed. Two key observations are that biology (breeding) and horticultural practices can reduce variabilities at the source and that publicly available benchmark data sets are needed to increase perception robustness and performance despite variability.",2019,152,0,10.1146/annurev-control-053018-023617,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02d2959cf0133ac5a84dd7756f0a4968ac5fd92f,JournalArticle,Annu.

260e7c1f644b04fc509f08edb73c3cadc0bdea6d,Step-Frequency Ground Penetrating Radar for Agricultural Soil Morphology Characterisation,"Soil morphology plays a fundamental role in the vertical and lateral movements of solutes and water transport, providing knowledge regarding spatial distribution of its textural properties and subsurface dynamics. In this framework, the measured values of electrical conductivity are able to reveal the heterogeneity of soil that is present in a particular agricultural field and they are affected by more than one important physical characteristic: soil texture, organic matter, moisture content, and the depth of the clay pan. In the microwave region, these dynamics are known to exhibit a frequency dependent behaviour. This study explores the application of a Step Frequency Continuous Wave Ground Penetrating Radar (SFCW GPR) to shed light on the practical impact that these dependencies have on the imaging results, not only regarding the electrical characterisation of the subsurface morphology, but also in its correct interpretation. This information is of notable importance for determining water-use efficiency and planning precision-agriculture programs. The results clearly show visible and significant fluctuations of the amplitude levels, depending on the considered central frequency, demonstrating that the frequency dependence of electromagnetic properties of heterogeneous soil are significant and cannot be ignored if the aim is to properly define the subsurface attributes. The measurements also suggest that correlating the delineated variations might help in the identification of extended features and the classification of areas that possess similar properties in order to increase the confidence in monitoring soil resources.",2019,24,1,10.3390/RS11091075,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/260e7c1f644b04fc509f08edb73c3cadc0bdea6d,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

Food production is often limited by scarcities in one or more of these resources. An integrated Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) Nexus planning and management approach promises improved resource efficiencies, new business opportunities, more coherent resource and environmental policies, and economies of scale for the data and information services underpinning better decision-making. This paper distils discussions on data and information from four regional workshops held as part of a Future Earth W-E-F Nexus Cluster project. The workshops aimed to enhance integrated management through better governance; collecting, analyzing, and communicating data and information; and integrating both for better planning and decision-making. Opportunities for enhancing food, energy, and water sustainability decisions through a data and information system are the focus of this paper. Data from each sector are needed to provide a full overview of the W-E-F Nexus. Relevant datasets and potential satellite products for water include water quality, watershed use change, snow and glacier monitoring, wetlands monitoring, water reservoir mapping, irrigation water management, aquifer monitoring, and measurements of critical water variables like precipitation, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration. Food and agricultural products include land use change maps, crop type mapping, crop acreage mapping, early warning indicators, yield assessment, precision agriculture, land degradation, clear-cut and burnt area maps, and soil moisture. Energy products include geological mapping, habitat assessment maps, logistic planning support, mine waste monitoring, renewable energy monitoring and mapping, and crop yield estimates for biofuels. However, specific priorities for W-E-F Nexus data products await further guidance from the W-E-F Nexus community. Data and information, along with modern technologies, can play a role in facilitating the paradigm shifts that benefit the W-E-F Nexus: explicitly assessing environmental services, meeting the growing urban food demand, valuing water and other resources used to produce food and energy for export, promoting resource use efficiency through integrated planning and management, and strengthening links between the W-E-F Nexus and the appropriate Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

This paper proposed a deep learning-based pipeline for localization and counting of agricultural pests in images by self-learning saliency feature maps. Our method integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) of ZF (Zeiler and Fergus model) and a region proposal network (RPN) with Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to remove overlapping detections. First, the convolutional layers in ZF Net, without average pooling layer and fc layers, were used to compute feature maps of images, which can better retain the original pixel information through smaller convolution kernels. Then, several critical parameters of the method were optimized, including the output size, score threshold, NMS threshold, and so on. To demonstrate the practical applications of our method, different feature extraction networks were explored, including AlexNet, ResNet and ZF Net. Finally, the model trained on smaller multi-scale images was tested on original large images. Experimental results showed that our method achieved a precision of 0.93 with a miss rate of 0.10.

Its judicious and optimum use is needed utmost for realizing higher resource use efficiency and plugging gaps in production. Key technological interventions, which could alter or rectify the usage pattern or strategies in freshwater utilization in agriculture, are the need of the hour. Precision water management approach could help in conserving and making more-efficient use of scarce water resources through integrated management combined with selected external inputs/technologies. In this context, the scientific interventions on water management involving precision levelling of land, no tillage or reduced tillage systems, furrow irrigated raised bed planting systems and other inclusive technological practices could enforce appropriate water management schedules. The potentials for water savings in rice production appear to be very large. But we do not know the degree to which various farm and system interventions will lead to sustainable water savings in the water basin until we can quantify the downstream impact of the interventions. Studies on the economic benefits and costs of alternative interventions are also lacking. Without this additional information, it will be difficult to identify the potential benefits and the most appropriate strategies for increasing irrigation water productivity in rice-based systems. During the crop growth period, the amount of water usually applied to the field is much more than the actual field requirement. When water supply within the irrigation system is unreliable, farmers try to store much more water in the field than needed as insurance against a possible shortage in the future. Rice transplanted on wide raised beds and transplanted rice under reduced tillage plots consumed more moisture from the deeper profile layer than conventional tillage practice Transplanted basmati rice after puddling recorded higher bulk density and more contribution from top layer. Dry-seeded rice technology offers a significant opportunity for conserving irrigation water by using rainfall more effectively. The future of rice production will therefore depend heavily on developing and adopting strategies and practices that will use water efficiently in irrigation schemes. This review paper emphasizes the need for integrating various water-saving measures into practical models and for conducting holistic assessments of their impact within and outside irrigation systems in the water basin.

In this paper, we use a mobile robot car to automatically capture the scene image in field, and we propose a method to detect and segment the pests/diseases in the acquired image. Firstly, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is constructed for the pest/disease from only one template pest image, then we take use of the logarithm similarity to the GMM and Aggregation Dispersion Variance (ADV) based approach to detect the specified pest/disease in plant. It is likely to make a wrong judgment when the pest is close to the lens. In order to avoid such mistake, we also combine the mean and the area as the classifier. Further, we employ the distance regularization level set evolution (DRLSE) driven by the similarity to evolve the contour toward the actual pest/disease contour. Taking the pests belonging to Pyralidae as a case study, the result shows that our method could automatically identify the positive and negative samples of the specific pest from a large number of scene images, and the recognition accuracy was up to 95%. For the positive samples, our algorithm could also segment the pests accurately, which shows that our method can realize the real-time detection of the specific pest, and also provide a feasible scheme for the establishment of pests' data set.",2019,4,1,10.1145/3330393.3330423,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b1b8c20a1cc928b4463f1d0e9fc150ecdf223b06,"JournalArticle,Book",ICMSSP

Furthermore, these temperature measurements have facilitated the development of advanced models of crop water stress and evapotranspiration in precision agriculture and heat fluxes exchanges in small river streams and corridors. Microbolometer cameras capture thermal information at blackbody or radiometric settings (narrowband emissivity equates to unity). While it is customary that the modeler uses assumed emissivity values (e.g. 0.99– 0.96 for agricultural and environmental settings); some applications (e.g. Vegetation Health Index), and complex models such as energy balance-based models (e.g. evapotranspiration) could benefit from spatial estimates of surface emissivity for true or kinetic temperature mapping. In that regard, this work presents an analysis of the spectral characteristics of a microbolometer camera with regard to emissivity, along with a methodology to infer thermal emissivity spatially based on the spectral characteristics of the microbolometer camera. For this work, the MODIS UCBS Emissivity Library, NASA HyTES hyperspectral emissivity, Landsat, and Utah State University AggieAir UAV surface reflectance products are employed. The methodology is applied to a commercial vineyard agricultural setting located in Lodi, California, where HyTES, Landsat, and AggieAir UAV spatial data were collected in the 2014 growing season.

In the proof-of-concept study, this strategy showed superior ability in identifying well-performing LFQs. An online tool incorporating this novel strategy was also developed. Graphical Abstract Highlights High-quality LFQ is valuable technique yet remains extremely challenging. Fluctuating precision, limited robustness, and compromised accuracy are known issues. We proposed a strategy collectively improving LFQ precision, robustness, and accuracy. An online tool incorporating this novel strategy was also developed. The label-free proteome quantification (LFQ) is multistep workflow collectively defined by quantification tools and subsequent data manipulation methods that has been extensively applied in current biomedical, agricultural, and environmental studies. Despite recent advances, in-depth and high-quality quantification remains extremely challenging and requires the optimization of LFQs by comparatively evaluating their performance. However, the evaluation results using different criteria (precision, accuracy, and robustness) vary greatly, and the huge number of potential LFQs becomes one of the bottlenecks in comprehensively optimizing proteome quantification. In this study, a novel strategy, enabling the discovery of the LFQs of simultaneously enhanced performance from thousands of workflows (integrating 18 quantification tools with 3,128 manipulation chains), was therefore proposed. First, the feasibility of achieving simultaneous improvement in the precision, accuracy, and robustness of LFQ was systematically assessed by collectively optimizing its multistep manipulation chains. Second, based on a variety of benchmark datasets acquired by various quantification measurements of different modes of acquisition, this novel strategy successfully identified a number of manipulation chains that simultaneously improved the performance across multiple criteria. Finally, to further enhance proteome quantification and discover the LFQs of optimal performance, an online tool (https://idrblab.org/anpela/) enabling collective performance assessment (from multiple perspectives) of the entire LFQ workflow was developed.

As a breakthrough in computer science, the emergence of deep learning approaches significantly expands the capability of traditional image processing. For instance, state-of-the-art results in identification and segmentation tasks have been achieved by deep-learning-based methods and the records are continually improved by their variants. It is an interesting topic to study how to incorporate deep-learning techniques into plant phenotype research, and various impactful methods have been proposed in the past few years.

30802c91468cab85627a79955c6c713bd36f63f3,Challenges of multi/hyper spectral images in precision agriculture applications,"According to the CEMA, Agriculture 4.0 paves the way for the next evolution of farming consisting of unmanned operations and autonomous decision systems while Agriculture 5.0 will be based around robotics and (some form of) artificial intelligence. It is clear how Agriculture is experimenting a Copernican Revolution where multidisciplinarity is the engine of this revolution. In this context it is central the topic of Variable Rate Treatments (VRTs). A VRT application relies on prescription maps that are generated by considering the agronomist experience augmented with data sensed also by using advanced platform as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or satellites. Prescription maps are usually implemented by tractors using Variable Rate Controllers (VRCs) that apply a given quantity of product on a given region. The typical operation is spraying nitrogen or weed treatment application over the agricultural field. The generation of a correct prescription map requires the definition of specific management zones that reflect areas and their status. The planning of agricultural tasks necessitates a deep knowledge of crop state, for example, an important but typical case is variable rate nitrogen fertilizer application. In this scenario multi-spectral images play a key role and today the technology is mature to be used also in real applications. Hyper-spectral imagery is still expensive and it is usually adopted for advanced research considering the complexity to acquire and post-process data. However multi and hyper spectral systems are changing the agriculture enabling complex analysis with ultra high spatial and spectral resolution.",2019,15,0,10.1088/1755-1315/275/1/012001,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30802c91468cab85627a79955c6c713bd36f63f3,Conference,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environment

588b290c81e4bab45189caace60c57a2bb42849b,Proposal of an ontological approach to design and analyse farm information systems to support Precision Agriculture techniques,"After a comparative evaluation around the concepts of Industry 4.0, Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming, the paper discusses the necessity of identifying solutions able to apply the methods of the so-called Knowledge Management 4.0 in the agri-environmental enterprises. To this aim, an ontology based on a conceptual map derived from the data-to-information transformation is here proposed to support the design of a new generation of Farm Information Systems (FIS) able to fit the production needs of agri-environmental enterprises. The data-to-information cycle is split into four phases: A) Data collection, B) Data processing, C) Data analysis and evaluation, and D) Use of information. Phases A and D comprise tools of “light digitization” typically referring to OLTP components (On Line Transactional Processes). On their turn, phases B and C are typically formed by “heavy digitization” components (On Line Analytical Processes), generally more complicated to be managed by the farmers directly. The conceptual map defined by the ontology is firstly useful to plan the composition of the FIS according to a modular approach, possibly following a strategy that starts to consider the introduction of OLTP components, for then evolving gradually towards more articulated solutions that include also OLAP component and related functions. In this way, decision makers can manage practical planning instrument able to show clearly the level of complexity a FIS can reach, thus evaluating its sustainability with respect to the financial, cultural and professional resources available at the farm. Finally, after having underlined the opportunities offered by Cloud Computing and widespread connectivity, that provide an easier adoption of OLAP tools, some application cases are presented and discussed.",2019,17,0,10.1088/1755-1315/275/1/012008,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/588b290c81e4bab45189caace60c57a2bb42849b,Conference,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environment

It is possible to survey wide areas in relatively short times (e.g., 5-10 min/ha) with a ground resolution of 40mm/pixel (GSD). Ground Instantaneous Field of View (GIFoV) areas are collected and rendered to prescription maps (tiling and 2D orthorectification): these show the overall condition of the crops and highlight the areas subjected to water or nutritional stress. Identification of the water stressed areas allows the technician/operator to assess the spatial variability of the crop (simple ratio) first, and then conducting field interventions/experiments, such as fertilization plans, weeding, parasite/pathogen management strategies and so on. The aim of this paper is to study the maize crop health condition by means of the remote sensing technique using UAV through the study of the relation between NDVI and TOC. Remote sensing performed at the time (18/06/2018) led to the acquisition of the basic photograms used for building prescription maps meaningful to the agronomic evaluation of the crop condition and progress. The canopy reflectance data (NDVI) of the maize crop were statistically analysed via the Student’s t-test. Although the agronomic inputs were uniformly distributed, including the strict genetic basis of the hybrid used, we can infer that such spatial variability is ascribable to the physic-chemical characteristics of the soil, its texture and, possibly, a surfeit of carbonates that compromises the availability of nutrients.",2019,1,0,10.22616/ERDEV2019.18.N290,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9838e0df33be956ba1d54d592d5daf7f358be950,Review,Engineering for Rural Development

Adoption has been greatest in developed agricultural countries. In this review article, the current situation of SSCM adoption and application is investigated from the perspective of a developed (UK) and developing (China) agricultural economy. The current state-of-the art is reviewed with an emphasis on developments in position system technology and satellite-based remote sensing. This is augmented with observations on the differences between the use of SSCM technologies and methodologies in the UK and China and discussion of the opportunities for (and limitations to) increasing SSCM adoption in developing agricultural economies.

Phenotyping of plants for breeding and for precision agriculture have different requirements due to different sizes of the plots and fields, differing purposes and the urgency of the action required after phenotyping. While in plant breeding phenotyping is done on several thousand small plots mainly to evaluate them for various traits, in plant cultivation, phenotyping is done in large fields to detect the occurrence of plant stresses and weeds at an early stage. The aim of this review is to highlight how various high-throughput phenotyping methods are used for plant breeding and farming and the key differences in the applications of such methods.

Intelligent methods are required to pinpoint weed infestations and make optimal choice of pesticide. UAV can fly a multispectral camera and collect data. However, the classification of multispectral images using supervised machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) requires large amount of training data. This is a common drawback in deep learning we try to circumvent making use of a semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (GAN), providing a pixel-wise classification for all the acquired multispectral images. Our algorithm consists of a generator network that provides photo-realistic images as extra training data to a multi-class classifier, acting as a discriminator and trained on small amounts of labeled data.

The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote-sensing system has a great application potential with the ability to obtain remote-sensing imagery with high temporal-spatial resolution. To verify the application potential of consumer-grade UAV RGB imagery in estimating maize above-ground biomass, vegetation indices and plant height derived from UAV RGB imagery were adopted. To obtain a more accurate observation, plant height was directly derived from UAV RGB point clouds. To search the optimal estimation method, the estimation performances of the models based on vegetation indices alone, based on plant height alone, and based on both vegetation indices and plant height were compared. The results showed that plant height directly derived from UAV RGB point clouds had a high correlation with ground-truth data with an R2 value of 0.90 and an RMSE value of 0.12 m. The above-ground biomass exponential regression models based on plant height alone had higher correlations for both fresh and dry above-ground biomass with R2 values of 0.77 and 0.76, respectively, compared to the linear regression model (both R2 values were 0.59). The vegetation indices derived from UAV RGB imagery had great potential to estimate maize above-ground biomass with R2 values ranging from 0.63 to 0.73. When estimating the above-ground biomass of maize by using multivariable linear regression based on vegetation indices, a higher correlation was obtained with an R2 value of 0.82. There was no significant improvement of the estimation performance when plant height derived from UAV RGB imagery was added into the multivariable linear regression model based on vegetation indices. When estimating crop above-ground biomass based on UAV RGB remote-sensing system alone, looking for optimized vegetation indices and establishing estimation models with high performance based on advanced algorithms (e.g., machine learning technology) may be a better way.",2019,137,9,10.3390/RS11111261,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c1a671c40fd7ec5c73cdc6d3386451c61c29bb94,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

1e8d7b3e954d3e55baf010bcab55abeabc148e2a,IoT based System for Smart Agriculture,"Agriculture is the most traditional activity over time. Since the beginning of it, agriculture has suffered many changes to improve productivity and quality of crops. Some of the first significant improvements have been remarked when machines and new tools such as irrigation systems, harvest machines, farmland clearing machines were introduced in the primitive agriculture, where these activities were performed mainly by humans and animals. Over time, agriculture has been affected by weather disasters (such as storms or extreme temperatures) and by natural disasters (such as pests and plant diseases). Thus, the next step in the development of the agriculture domain was to propose the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for monitoring of many parameters for better precision agriculture.

To this effect, various optical techniques have recently been employed to characterize the biochemical processes in various parts of the plants [1]. Terahertz (THz) region (0.3–10 THz) has gathered momentum in this field as it is biologically safe, can penetrate food packaging and most importantly, has fingerprinting ability of various organic and inorganic molecules due to active rotational and vibrational modes [2]. Moreover, unlike other optical spectroscopic techniques, THz time domain spectroscopic (THz-TDS) technique records the information in form of THz electric field; which once converted to frequency domain provides both amplitude and phase information [3]. Additionally, THz waves are highly absorbed by water which in turn can be utilized for quantitative water status monitoring in plants [4].",2019,0,0,10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8872954,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/259b6bebdcd71a94542134fd6326680a009303eb,Conference,2019 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)

2bf467cf613e818dc7ecb6262462e235930e4a02,A new facility for UAV testing in climate-controlled environments*,"Environmental conditions have a great influence on aircraft performance. Thrust reduction with altitude and temperature increase is a well known problem in the aviation industry. For commercial multirotor (UAVs) a systematic approach on performance varying environmental conditions is still an open research field. Many of the existing applications designed for UAVs (e.g. precision agriculture, delivery of instruments or medical supplies) have not been fully exploited by the market so far. This is due to the lack of existing knowledge about flight under variable weather conditions. A bias in the existing tests has been the non-reproducibility of the same climatic conditions. In this paper a dedicated test facility for a systematic study on UAV performance in a climate-controlled laboratory is presented: use cases as well as technical challenges related to the particular environment are discussed. Preliminary tests on thrust performance at different temperatures are reported to provide insight and highlight measurement complexities involved in harsh environmental conditions. Ultimately, this work will facilitate the development of UAV design and safety accounting for weather influence to improve flight stability and controllability.",2019,6,0,10.1109/ICUAS.2019.8798066,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2bf467cf613e818dc7ecb6262462e235930e4a02,Conference,International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems

To achieve a particular goal of improved yield and quality in vineyard management, it is essential to understand the impact of plant–soil–water dynamics at different phenological growth stages of the plant physiology. Irrigation system is one of the most important factors for successful agricultural production. Contemporary plant production is based on the better utilization of water per unit area, i.e. to achieve as much yield as possible, while reducing the amount of invested resources (water, fertilizers). The paper presents the results of research carried out within the company 13. Jul Plantaže and the use of irrigNET system in order to optimize irrigation of vines. At several micro localities with different vine varieties, 28 sensor devices have been installed on the Ćemovsko field to monitor moisture dew in the soil at different depths.

57592c34d97ecd4237732b3ce83a242a5a080799,Autonomic Computing Challenges in Fully Autonomous Precision Agriculture,"Precision agriculture examines crop fields, gathers data, analyzes crop health and informs field management. This data driven approach can reduce fertilizer runoff, prevent crop disease and increase yield. Frequent data collection improves outcomes, but also increases operating costs. Fully autonomous aerial systems (FAAS) can capture detailed images of crop fields without human intervention. They can reduce operating costs significantly. However, FAAS software must embed agricultural expertise to decide where to fly, which images to capture and when to land. This paper explores fully autonomous precision agriculture where FAAS map crop fields frequently. We have designed hardware and software architecture. We use unmanned aerial systems, edge computing components and software driven by reinforcement learning and ensemble models. In early results, we have collected data from an Ohio cornfield. We use this data to simulate a FAAS modeling crop yield. Our results (1) show that our approach predicts yield well and (2) can quantify computational demand. Computational costs can be prohibitive. We discuss how research on adaptive systems can reduce costs and enable fully autonomous precision agriculture.

a3c5a05f28a533292fd92f59bcfca365f4136d01,The economic essence of the category of precision agriculture,"Precision agriculture technologies started in late 1980s in the United States and Australia with the development of a global positioning system (GPS), geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing and simulation modeling. Their use increase crop yields, the efficiency of fertilizer application and plant protection products, and reduce the agrochemical load on the environment and improve significantly the quality of crop production. According to the Ministry of Agriculture of the RF by the end of 2018, the share of coverage of agricultural lands with these technologies had been 10%. According to the experts of the Kuban State Agrarian University, the elements of precision farming are used in 52 regions, the Krasnodar territory is a leader in the number of farms (189 farms). One can find the following synonyms of the category ""precision agriculture"" in the scientific literature: precision farming, coordinate farming, information technology, technology using GPS, etc. The basic stages in the system of precision agriculture can be grouped in a primary exploratory analysis, an analysis of monitoring results and development of field treatment strategies for a specific agricultural operation or in general, introduction of relevant agro-technological operations. On the territory of Russia, it is possible to use the American NAVSTAR and (or) the Russian GLONASS in precision agricultural technologies. The use of digital technologies will improve the efficiency of agricultural production significantly. A further study of the conceptual framework of this field of research is relevant.

To extract meaningful information from large-scale aerial images collected from the field, high-throughput phenotypic analysis solutions are required, which not only produce high-quality measures of key crop traits, but also support professionals to make prompt and reliable crop management decisions. Here, we report AirSurf, an automated and open-source analytic platform that combines modern computer vision, up-to-date machine learning, and modular software engineering in order to measure yield-related phenotypes from ultra-large aerial imagery. To quantify millions of in-field lettuces acquired by fixed-wing light aircrafts equipped with normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) sensors, we customised AirSurf by combining computer vision algorithms and a deep-learning classifier trained with over 100,000 labelled lettuce signals. The tailored platform, AirSurf-Lettuce, is capable of scoring and categorising iceberg lettuces with high accuracy (>98%). Furthermore, novel analysis functions have been developed to map lettuce size distribution across the field, based on which associated global positioning system (GPS) tagged harvest regions have been identified to enable growers and farmers to conduct precision agricultural practises in order to improve the actual yield as well as crop marketability before the harvest.",2019,130,4,10.1038/s41438-019-0151-5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a934f039fc0c630b23f978a5c2673c80d9d69f3c,JournalArticle,Horticulture Research

In countries where input-intensive agriculture is practiced, these developments and trends over the past decade include renewed efforts by the agrichemical industry in herbicide discovery, cultivation of crops with combined (stacked) HR traits, increasing reliance on preemergence vs. postemergence herbicides, breeding for weed-competitive crop cultivars, expansion of harvest weed seed control practices, and advances in site-specific or precision weed management. The unifying framework or strategy underlying these developments and trends is mitigation of viable weed seeds into the soil seed bank and maintaining low weed seed banks to minimize population proliferation, evolution of resistance to additional herbicidal sites of action, and spread. A key question going forward is: how much weed control is enough to consistently achieve the goal of low weed seed banks? The vision for future HR weed management programs must be sustained crop production and profitability with reduced herbicide (particularly glyphosate) dependency.",2019,122,3,10.3390/plants8060161,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac9f4882278de0186b084c7468045485a560a6d6,"Review,JournalArticle",Plants
b3560fe15db7131509189ca67643f98f877dbfba,Soil-Landscape Characterization and Mapping to Advance the State of Spatial Soil Information on Ethiopian Highlands: Implications for Site-Specific Soil Management,"Currently, soil characterization and classification are becoming the primary source of information for precision agriculture, land use planning, and management. Thus, this study was focused on perusing the landscape-scale spatial variation of soils in data-scarce areas using toposequence-based ground sampling to characterize and classify the soils. Six typical profiles representing major landforms were opened and studied for their morphological characteristics and physical and chemical properties. Results indicated that the soils were shallow to very deep in depth, moderately acidic to moderately alkaline in soil reaction, non-saline, and clay to sandy loam in texture. The soils were found to be very low to low in organic carbon, very low to medium in total nitrogen , low to medium in available P, very low in available S, very low to low in available B, high to very high in CEC and very low to very high in base saturation. The soils were found to tbe deficient in Zn but sufficient in Fe, Cu, and Mn. Following the field survey and soil analytical results, five main reference soil groups, mollic Leptosols (Eutric), Prothovertio Luvisols (Clayic, Aric, Escalic), Skeletic Fluvisols (Arenic, Densic), Haplic Leptosols (Skeletic), Haplic Vertisols (Endocalcaric, Ochric), and Haplic Cambisols (Arenic, Aric) were identified in the different parts of the topographic positions. Pedon - 2, 3, 5, and 6 were classified in I to IV land capability class (LCC) and grouped as arable land with some limitations. They were in suitable to a marginally suitable range. The severe constraints to crop cultivation in the area were low fertility, erosion hazard, and climate for all soil units. Therefore, application of manure and compost alongwith chemical fertilizer, reducing complete crop residue removal, and soil and water conservation measures are essential to overcome these common and other limitations.",2019,1,1,10.47114/j.agroped.2022.jun4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3560fe15db7131509189ca67643f98f877dbfba,Review,Agropedology

cd50aa9128f186fb593dbea2c749254068fb440b,Building Mosaics Using Images Autonomously Acquired by a UAV,"In this work we discuss an application related either to fire fighting or to precision agriculture, which consists in building mosaics from aerial images acquired by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - a UAV, specifically a quadrotor. The odometry of the vehicle is used to help estimating the position of each new image to be included in the mosaic, and, thus, matching features present in the overlapping areas of the images. Navigation and image acquisition are done autonomously, with a pre-set route in which a set of waypoints is defined. Images are acquired while the quadrotor keeps itself hovering in each waypoint, after testing such a possibility against the option correspondent to get images with the quadrotor flying between two of them. For choosing between these two cases the mosaics are built and compared, leading to the decision of using the images acquired with the quadrotor hovering over each waypoint. To improve the mosaics built, information provided by a GPS module onboard the UAV about the position from where each image is acquired is also included in the mosaic, to allow getting better information about the area under inspection, which can be, for instance, an area in which fire outbreaks are being searched or a farming area being inspected.",2019,1,0,10.1109/ICUAS.2019.8797875,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cd50aa9128f186fb593dbea2c749254068fb440b,Conference,International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems
cf25a8271b0e99ceb760d66272c2eaac9cd47151,Optimal Design of Experiments for Precision Agriculture Using a Genetic Algorithm,"Variable Rate Application (VRA) is a popular technique in Precision Agriculture used to decrease the amount of fertilizer applied to a specific field while increasing profitability, effectively also reducing environmental impact. VRA tries to determine the rate of fertilizer to apply to different parts of a field based on a variety of factors, such as precipitation, elevation, and previous years’ yield. To determine the appropriate variable nitrogen application rate for a field, experiments have to be conducted that provide data on how certain parts of the field react to specific nitrogen rates. In this research, a VRA of nitrogen is applied to fields of winter wheat in Montana where these experiments require the creation of a prescription map, which creates a grid of the field. The goal of the experiments is to vary nitrogen rate application, to determine how these nitrogen rates affect yield and protein production. However, when creating these prescription maps large jumps between consecutive cells’ nitrogen rates often occur, putting strain on the farming equipment. To reduce the number of jumps while maintaining even distribution of nitrogen rates across different yield and protein bins, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used for optimization. The GA uses a multi-objective fitness function aiming to minimize jumps and maintain stratification. The results show that the GA is effective in meeting these goals for the fields studied.",2019,15,0,10.1109/CEC.2019.8790267,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf25a8271b0e99ceb760d66272c2eaac9cd47151,JournalArticle,IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation

Since UAVs for industrial purposes are usually large and carry large batteries, high-power charger is preferable for fast charging. Although wireless charging stations for UAVs have recently been reported in the literature, the charging powers in those reports are 150 W or less, to the knowledge of the authors. This paper summarizes the design of a prototype 450-W inductive power transfer system in the 85-kHz band for application to the wireless charging port of a large UAV and reports the measured results. The proposed structure and shape of the wireless charging port for the UAV is described. The measurement of the prototype shows that received dc power is approximately 450 W, indicating the potential for application to the fast wireless charging port of a large UAV.",2019,20,2,10.1109/WPTC45513.2019.9055626,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d5caa3023df3030bbdcbeffd59d6ed50dd89e3d5,Conference,IEEE Wireless Power Transfer Conference
d5ecf4a995a6ec1a0c2fae684d706fbcc5b4ad34,Automatic Analysis of Potential Hazard Events Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"This paper is motivated by the possibility of developing a wide variety of applications and domains in which Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be used globally for various purposes. UAVs are currently used by public administrations and security forces such as police, fire brigades, civil protection, research institutions, construction, and agriculture entities. The purpose of this paper is to facilitate the handling of UAVs to retrieve various data from the environment. The drone (UAV) visits some points to collect data (image and/or video input) from sensors like GPS, camera, gyroscope, and accelerometer. GPS sensor coordinates are used to compare the data taken with subsequent results through processing with specialized software. The drone is used as an access gate with built-in sensors. Certain hazard events (fires, floods, avalanches, landslides) are not limited to narrow geographical areas, but can impact the environment by triggering negative chain events. 3D modeling offers a wide range of possibilities to prevent potential hazard events, or, if such an event has occurred, makes it possible to monitor the affected area and assess the damage by comparing the area in the pre-event configuration with the after-event one. After image processing and data acquisition, a report is generated that includes the map and the 3D model of the analyzed object. A hazard is an agent that has the potential to cause damage to a particular target. Terms such as risk or danger can be used in similar contexts. TensorFlow is an open source software library in high-performance computing. Flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computing on a variety of platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU), from desktop to server or mobile devices. We used the learning transfer: at first we used a model that was already prepared for another problem, and then we re-qualified it on a similar problem. Deep learning from scratch can take several days, but learning transfer can be done shortly. We applied Python along with TensorFlow to train an image classifier and classify images with it. We formed a consistent set of training pictures, using three labels: fire, flood (detectable hazards) and nature (non-hazard images). We then re-qualified an efficient, small-sized neural network by (re)training the image set in order to get the best results in the hazards prediction selection process with a progressive higher accuracy as (re) training evolves at optimal rating. With Python and OpenCV technologies, we used four decision algorithms to generate prediction of hazard: Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier. Each generated report includes precision, recall, f1-score, and support indices, depending on the class and intervals used. We also used the confusion matrix as an alternative method to evaluate the classification accuracy. Analyzing the 4 algorithms we noticed that they behave differently. Training using TensorFlow generated better results than the other methods. For the main classes tested hazard is recognized up to 99%.",2019,4,0,10.1109/ECAI46879.2019.9042120,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d5ecf4a995a6ec1a0c2fae684d706fbcc5b4ad34,"JournalArticle,Conference",European Conference on Artificial Intelligence

Although there are multiple works that explore security through device identification, cryptography and network security protocols, the question of can we trust the integrity of things to represent reality or precisely, can we trust the data and the metrics being sent by things, remains largely unanswered in distributed wireless scenarios. Given how nascent the domain is and the rapid pace at which IoT is being adopted, ensuring that the data from each of these devices is trustable is very challenging. Moreover, the problem becomes harder in wireless sensor network scenario, especially in harsh environments, due to the potential avenues for spoofing and physical attacks.

The growth process of fruit trees is accompanied by a large number of monitoring and management activities, such as pruning, irrigation, fertilization, spraying, and harvesting, which are labour intensive and time consuming. In the context of precision agriculture, automation and precision orchard management not only saves labour resources and increases the income of growers, but also has great significance in improving resource utilization. Recent technological developments enable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, also commonly referred to as Unmanned Aerial Systems, or ‘drones’) to become an efficient monitoring tool for improving orchard management, that can provide growers much more detailed and precise information about fruit crops health status, geometric variables, physiological variables etc. This paper reviews the use of UAVs in orchard management, with a focus on recent UAV applications, synthetically describing the existing situation (e.g., general data processing approaches, sensing platform and sensor uploaded). The challenges and prospects of UAVs opportunities in orchard management are also summarized.

Recent developments in sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and the ubiquity of the Internet of Things (IoT) have increased the collection of data (including health care, social media, smart cities, agriculture, finance, education, and more) to an enormous scale. However, the data collected from sensors, social media, financial records, etc. is inherently uncertain due to noise, incompleteness, and inconsistency. The analysis of such massive amounts of data requires advanced analytical techniques for efficiently reviewing and/or predicting future courses of action with high precision and advanced decision-making strategies. As the amount, variety, and speed of data increases, so too does the uncertainty inherent within, leading to a lack of confidence in the resulting analytics process and decisions made thereof. In comparison to traditional data techniques and platforms, artificial intelligence techniques (including machine learning, natural language processing, and computational intelligence) provide more accurate, faster, and scalable results in big data analytics. Previous research and surveys conducted on big data analytics tend to focus on one or two techniques or specific application domains. However, little work has been done in the field of uncertainty when applied to big data analytics as well as in the artificial intelligence techniques applied to the datasets.

One of the main tools for high resolution remote sensing and photogrammetry is the lightweight hyperspectral frame camera, that is used in several application areas such as precision agriculture, forestry, and environmental monitoring. Among these types of sensors, the Rikola (which is based on a Fabry–Perot interferometer (FPI) and produced by Senop) is one of the latest innovations. Due to its internal geometry, there are several issues to be addressed for the appropriate definition and estimation of the inner orientation parameters (IOPs). The main problems concern the possibility to change every time the sequence of the bands and to assess the reliability of the IOPs. This work focuses the attention on the assessment of the IOPs definition for each sensor, considering the impact of environmental conditions (e.g., different time, exposure, brightness) and different configurations of the FPI camera, in order to rebuild an undistorted hypercube for image processing and object estimation. The aim of this work is to understand if the IOPs are stable over the time and if and which bands can be used as reference for the calculation of the inner parameters for each sensor, considering different environmental configurations and surveys, from terrestrial to aerial applications. Preliminary performed tests showed that the focal length percentage variation among the bands of different experiments is around 1%.

8f64e281d3b8b99cb76595ccdbcad03b1743a08d,UAV/SATELLITE MULTISCALE DATA FUSION FOR CROP MONITORING AND EARLY STRESS DETECTION,"Abstract. Early stress detection is critical for proactive field management and terminal yield prediction, and can aid policy making for improved food security in the context of climate change and population growth. Field surveys for crop monitoring are destructive, labor-intensive, time-consuming and not ideal for large-scale spatial and temporal monitoring. Recent technological advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and high-resolution satellite imaging with frequent revisit time have proliferated the applications of this emerging new technology in precision agriculture to address food security challenges from regional to global scales. In this paper, we present a concept of UAV and satellite virtual constellation to demonstrate the power of multi-scale imaging for crop monitoring. Low-cost sensors integrated on a UAV were used to collect RGB, multispectral, and thermal images during the growing season in a test site established near Columbia, Missouri, USA. WorldView-3 multispectral data were pan-sharpened, atmospherically corrected to reflectance and combined with UAV data for temporal monitoring of early stress. UAV thermal and multispectral data were calibrated to canopy temperature and reflectance following a rigorous georeferencing and ortho-correction. The results show that early stress can be effectively detected using multi-temporal and multi-scale UAV and satellite observation; the limitations of satellite remote sensing data in field-level crop monitoring can be overcome by using low altitude UAV observations addressing not just mixed pixel issues but also filling the temporal gap in satellite data availability enabling capture of early stress. The concept developed in this paper also provides a framework for accurate and robust estimation of plant traits and grain yield and delivers valuable insight for high spatial precision in high-throughput phenotyping and farm field management.

Many UAV tunable parameters can have significant impact on data quality and the data analysis, such as flight height, flight time, overlapping, and airspeed. And, little work has been done regarding to how to extract high-resolution multispectral or thermal images with limited ground-truth measurements. Therefore, in this paper, a UAV resolution and waveband aware design was conducted in order to optimally collecting remote sensing aerial images with drones. Then, the flight mission design was tested in an onion field at USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) during the growing season in 2017. Based on the research results, drones successfully provide farmers and researchers the fundamental knowledge of irrigation management to identify irrigation non-uniformity. Using multispectral and thermal images collected by drones, we are able to apply supervised learning methods to find the relationship between image features and onions irrigation treatments. It also found out that how drones flight height or resolution settings affect the accuracy of estimating onions irrigation treatment. Different spectral bands combination also has effect on onion irrigation treatment prediction.",2019,20,1,10.1109/ICUAS.2019.8798188,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40e709c0586f09f0745449c058de8217ada78d38,Conference,International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems

A rapid multiresidue method had been developed for detecting carbofuran and carbaryl, types of carbamate insecticide, in agriculture soil. This method was based on shaking extraction followed by solid phase extraction (SPE) of soil samples. Residue content of this carbamate insecticide was analyzed by using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. Carbofuran and carbaryl were separated by using a C-18 column and acetonitrile-water as the mobile phase. In this study, soil samples were taken from three locations (Pangalengan, Lembang and Cisarua) for detecting the content of carbamate insecticide. Precision test of Pengalengan soil sample in wet season for carbofuran and carbaryl were obtained at 5.42% and 6.75%, respectively. Recovery testing was carried out by using the fortification technique in which respectively 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg content of carbofuran and carbaryl were spiked into the samples. The average recovery was in the range of 80.53 to 82.06 % and the standard deviation was between 3.78 and 4.51% for carbofuran and carbaryl, respectively. The calibration curve provided linear results in the concentration range of 0.05 to 10 μg/mL and 0.025 to 11.2 μg/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.9999 and 0.9999 for carbofuran and carbaryl, respectively. On average, carbofuran and carbaryl in the soil were detected at 0.3350 and 0.2958 μg/g, respectively, for both samples from Pangalengan and Lembang during dry season while neither of these compounds was detected in Cisarua and Pangalengan during the wet season. This shows that carbamate insecticides had been washed out form soil by rainwater during the wet season or through degradation pathways in the environment.",2019,0,0,10.1088/1755-1315/277/1/012023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e17b5543199ff6fe660d57bed9d9cc9d4419894c,Conference,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environment

We hypothesised that the agriculturally important trait of C4 photosynthesis is accessible to modelling because it evolved from an ancestral ground state of C3 photosynthesis. All genes required for C4 are present in C3 but not arranged in a pathway. Plants performing C4 metabolism are capable of highly efficient carbon fixation and consequentially are adapted to adverse growth conditions and/or are capable of high growth rates. We hypothesised that constraint-based modelling will identify the selective pressures under which C4 photosynthesis evolves. Indeed, a carefully curated two-celled model predicts C4 under two different selective pressures. The model attributed differences between extant metabolic flavours of C4 to light availability and distribution. Likely kinetic constraints on reactions were identified for flux solutions which did not match known physiological fluxes.

The deep learning models have the capability to learn complex features from the dataset available, and specific to the problem at hand. In this research, the aim is to classify field parcels in images from the Sentinel-2A satellite and identify the corresponding crops using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To obtain a good classification network, the mandatory requirement is clean and reliably labelled data, which is a challenging task in real world applications. What if the labels are not reliable due to manual errors or due to the complexity of annotating data? The purpose of this project is to design a pipeline to verify the reliability of the data with minimum supervision and then, use the clean data to train the network for the classification problem at hand. Experiments on different crop types (Wheat, Maize, and Legumes) have shown excellent results in distinguishing a variety from others. The pixellevel classifier model not only allows training of the model with limited available data but also gives an advantage of further analysing the crop area on a sub-parcel level. The proposed approach for detection and classification of vegetation types creates a new possibility in handling Big Data in the domain of Earth Observation with a multitude of potential applications in the areas of precision and smart agriculture, pre-emptive forest management, health monitoring, and damage assessment.

The manual process of plant diseases diagnosis is a key challenge from last one decade; therefore, researchers in this area introduced automated systems. In this research work, automated system is proposed for citrus fruit diseases recognition using computer vision technique. The proposed method incorporates five fundamental steps such as preprocessing, disease segmentation, feature extraction and reduction, fusion, and classification. The noise is being removed followed by a contrast stretching procedure in the very first phase. Later, watershed method is applied to excerpt the infectious regions. The shape, texture, and color features are subsequently computed from these infection regions. In the fourth step, reduced features are fused using serial‐based approach followed by a final step of classification using multiclass support vector machine. For dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis is utilized, which is a statistical procedure that enforces an orthogonal transformation on a set of observations.

Application of information technologies in agriculture, smart agriculture, aims to realize precision control of irrigation, fertilizer, diseases, and insect pests prevention in the growing of crops. For the sake of obtaining the interest data, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used to collect the interest data in the farm field and send the obtained data to the servers via wireless communication. Since the WSNs usually operate in the unlicensed spectrum, the available resource elements (REs) are scarce especially when a large number of sensor nodes are deployed in the farm field. To accommodate more sensor nodes and prolong the lifetime of the WSNs in agriculture, relay-aided non-orthogonal multiple access is introduced into the uplink transmission stage of the direct transmission from the sensor nodes to the sink node. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can transmit multiple symbols simultaneously on the same RE by splitting them in the power domain and distinguish them according to diverse power levels of different symbols. The average sum data rate and outage probability of the relay-aided NOMA in uplink transmission are theoretically analyzed. The numerical simulation results show that the WSNs with relay-aided NOMA outperforms the traditional OMA scheme in uplink transmission in WSNs in agriculture.",2019,58,0,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2924917,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b6901941e0921cf93f49ee0a821c8144196db5c,JournalArticle,IEEE Access

The classical CRISPR/Cas system was derived from a bacterial defense system, which consists of a single guide RNA (sgRNA) for precise targeting and one Cas protein for DNA binding and nuclease activity. Relying on high precision of CRISPR/Cas system, multiple functions have been exploited in addition to original nuclease activity, such as genome base editing, gene knock-down and activation, chromatin imaging systems etc. (Barrangou and Doudna, 2016; Wang and Qi, 2016).

As many times the area of operation of these robots is very large, it becomes unfeasible the fulfillment of the activity using a single robot, but even using many robots, there is the limitation of the battery autonomy. With the popularization of autonomous robots use, the search for mechanisms to make these robots recharge their battery autonomously are impulsed, however, the choice of the best place to insert the charging stations considering the displacement time saved and use of battery to move the robots is a challenge. The present work shows a Java Desktop graphical application that makes use of the JST library that requests data to the user, such as the map of the place to be explored, quantity of charging stations, if these stations must be in static places, perhaps due to electrical outlet locations restriction, or if they could be dynamically placed. Based on these data an optimal solution to insert the charging stations as well as the definition of each robot activity area are presented. Algorithms such as Voronoi, Viktor Grabarchuk and Centroid position are used in this process. The Voronoi Algorithm allowed the balanced division of the action area into a group of robots considering static recharge positions.

Apples are the most consumed fruits in Korea and have played an economically important role in Korean agriculture. However, widespread viroid infection in apples had been reported in recent years.


OBJECTIVES
The objective of this study was to clarify the relationships between viroid-disease resistance and phenols content of three apple cultivars: ""Fuji"", ""Gamhong"", and ""Hongro"". A model for distinguishing between viroid-free and viroid-infected apples was also developed.


METHODOLOGY
Phenolic compounds in samples were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography photodiode array tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-PDA-MS/MS) and quantified using an ultraviolet detector at 280 nm. A C18 -column and 0.5% aqueous acetic acid-methanol were used as the stationary and mobile phase. The HPLC method was validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, and recovery. Multivariate analysis was performed using phenols content as variables to classify viroid-free and viroid-infected apples.


RESULTS
An accurate method for identifying and quantifying phenol compounds in apple samples was developed and validated. In response to viroid infection, considerable increases in the content of dihydrochalcones (in all three cultivars), hydroxycinnamic acid (in ""Fuji""), and flavonols (in ""Hongro"") were observed. The flavonols content in ""Fuji"" viroid-infected samples, however, decreased dramatically. An effective linear discriminant model, with 98.2% accuracy and 94.6% predictive ability, was achieved to discriminate between viroid-free and viroid-infected samples.


CONCLUSION
The developed HPLC method is suitable to identify and quantify phenol compounds in viroid-free and viroid-infected apples. A hypothesis about the significance of these compounds in viroid-disease resistance was proposed. The linear discriminant model with high predictive ability is useful for identifying viroid-infected apples in the orchards.",2019,4,0,10.1002/pca.2822,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0abf7a03c96f493f513fcbd75ef53e67a18635ad,JournalArticle,Phytochemical Analysis

16bb64ff712644cd915830ca1f92f67b8a73c24a,Application of Near-infrared Spectroscopy and Multiple Spectral Algorithms to Explore the Effect of Soil Particle Sizes on Soil Nitrogen Detection,"Soil nitrogen is the key parameter supporting plant growth and development; it is also the material basis of plant growth. An accurate grasp of soil nitrogen information is the premise of scientific fertilization in precision agriculture, where near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is widely used for rapid detection of soil nutrients. In this study, the variation law of soil NIR reflectivity spectra with soil particle sizes was studied. Moreover, in order to precisely study the effect of particle size on soil nitrogen detection by NIR, four different spectra preprocessing methods and five different chemometric modeling methods were used to analyze the soil NIR spectra. The results showed that the smaller the soil particle sizes, the stronger the soil NIR reflectivity spectra. Besides, when the soil particle sizes ranged 0.18–0.28 mm, the soil nitrogen prediction accuracy was the best based on the partial least squares (PLS) model with the highest Rp2 of 0.983, the residual predictive deviation (RPD) of 6.706. The detection accuracy was not ideal when the soil particle sizes were too big (1–2 mm) or too small (0–0.18 mm). In addition, the relationship between the mixing spectra of six different soil particle sizes and the soil nitrogen detection accuracy was studied. It was indicated that the larger the gap between soil particle sizes, the worse the accuracy of soil nitrogen detection. In conclusion, soil nitrogen detection precision was affected by soil particle sizes to a large extent. It is of great significance to optimize the pre-treatments of soil samples to realize rapid and accurate detection by NIR spectroscopy.",2019,18,1,10.3390/molecules24132486,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/16bb64ff712644cd915830ca1f92f67b8a73c24a,JournalArticle,Molecules

Accurate crop yield prediction is an indispensable part of modern agricultural technologies to ensure food security and sustainability encountered in agricultural production. Since environmental conditions highly affect a plant’s growth, accurate estimation of crop yield can provide a lot of information that can be used for maintaining the quality of crop production. In this paper, a deep learning architecture is utilized to estimate crop yield in field images. The plant images are captured every half an hour by cameras mounted on the ground agricultural stations. We utilize intermediate outputs of deep learning architectures to develop a measure for an approximate estimate crop yield. This estimate represents a relative measure for crop yield estimate, relative to the high crop yield estimates in agricultural parcels that were used while training the deep learning architecture. We experimented our approach on sunflower image sequences collected from four different parcels and obtained promising results.",2019,27,1,10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820693,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f96f37b4a6811b58b15a1088de087a3734285a8,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics

Meanwhile, as its autonomy increases, so does its cost, and with the price of a single fixed-wing vehicle it is possible to purchase a swarm of several rotary-wing vehicles. The present study presents a theoretical and practical comparison to identify the most favorable scenarios for the use of Fixed-Wing and Rotating-Wing type air vehicles, making a qualitative comparison with data obtained from the vehicles Datasheet and a quantitative comparison, divided into two moments: with theoretical data calculated based on data retrieved from Datasheets, and with real data obtained from flights. At the end of the work, it is concluded that for linear flights, for example the monitoring of roads or frontiers, the superiority is held by fixed-wing vehicles. As for flights monitoring two-dimensional areas, where precision agriculture is commonly applied, the superiority is that of rotating-wings, which are able to do the same work in a lesser time than fixed-wings, with the advantages of having lower cost and greater flight dynamic, given their maneuverability, in addition to being easily applied on the autonomous flights, since the operations of takeoff and landing do not need the human interaction, since they happen vertically.",2019,4,0,10.1109/COMPSAC.2019.10259,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22591027b2a60e3b7a78da8ca685221d258c872f,"JournalArticle,Conference",Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference

In order to solve these problems, precision agriculture (PA) has been applied to achieve precise management of agricultural water and fertilizer. In PA process, fine mapping of soil nutrient is an effective technology to acquire accurate water and fertilizer distribution information and make agricultural decision. A significant progress has been made in digital soil mapping (DSM) of soil nutrient content over the past 20 years. However, the accuracy of grid-based DSM cannot meet the practical application needs of PA. This paper proposed a fine DSM method of soil nutrient content using high resolution remote sensing images and multi-scale auxiliary data for PA application. Three key technologies were studied for the implementation of this method. The automatic extraction of fine mapping units was the basis of this method. We designed different automatic extraction methods based on high resolution remote sensing images for agricultural production units in plains and mountainous areas. The auxiliary variables in different scales were chosen and converted to construct fine-scale soil nutrient-environment relationship model. Finally, machine learning methods were used to map the spatial distribution of soil nutrients. We chose Zhongning County, Ningxia Province as the study area, which includes typical plain and mountainous agriculture. The proposed method and technologies were applied for typical soil nutrients mapping. A common grid-based spatial interpolation method was implemented with the same soil sample dataset to evaluate the effect of the proposed method. The result showed that this method could reduce the number of prediction units and effectively improve the prediction efficiency in both plain and mountainous areas for fine soil mapping and precision agriculture application. This study was an attempt to realize fine soil mapping based on PA application unit in different environments. The high-resolution remote sensing images provide basic data for the realization of this idea, and the conversion technology of multi-scale data provides better support for the spatial inference of fine soil attribute information.

This study reviews the public data on farm level use of PA in crop production worldwide. It examines adoption estimates for PA from completed surveys that utilized random sampling procedures, as well as estimates of adoption using other survey methods, with an objective to document the national or regional level adoption patterns of PA using existing data. The analysis indicates that Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) guidance and associated automated technologies like sprayer boom control and planter row or section shutoffs have been adopted as fast as any major agricultural technology in history. The main reason for the perception that PA adoption is slow is because PA is often associated with variable rate technology (VRT)—just one of many PA technologies, one of the first adopted by many farmers, but that now rarely exceeds 20% of farms. This level of adoption suggests that farmers like the idea of VRT, but are not convinced of its value. VRT adoption estimates for niche groups of farmers may exceed 50%.

In recent years, affordable GPS modules targeted for Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning have reached the mass market with price ranging from 25 to 3,500 USD. These modules come with several choices: single frequency, multi-frequency, and multi-satellite. This paper discusses the evaluation on the performance of multi-frequency low-cost GPS module with parameters such as baseline and telecommunication signal taken into consideration. Telecommunication signal data from three providers, Telkomsel, Indosat, and 3, are obtained from OpenSignal. This paper focuses on the accuracy of the positions obtained. The multi-frequency GPS module was used to obtain positions in open sky environments. From the results of the experiment done in this research, it can be concluded that RTK-NTRIP measurements using multi-frequency GPS module produce mostly centimeter and sub-meter level of accuracy in most areas with strong signal strength. However, RTK solution in meter accuracy was also found in the data. This is due to the fact that the observation data was not filtered using signal to noise ratio (SNR) threshold, where previous research showed more consistent data using the minimum SNR threshold value 30. Therefore, the performance of a multi-frequency GPS module is proved to be unstable.",2019,1,0,10.1109/ICST47872.2019.9166367,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c33bfbf41861c7b148baea222f84c5df265caf8,Conference,International Conference on Information Control Systems & Technologies

For this reason, analytical models and simulation tools able to investigate its behavior in different scenarios are of the utmost importance for driving current and future research activities. Unfortunately, scientific literature partially addresses the current open issues by means of simplified and, in many cases, not standard-compliant approaches.

First, it presents a flexible, open-source, and 3GPP-compliant implementation of the NB-IoT random access procedure. Second, it formulates an analytical model capturing both collision and success probabilities associated with the aforementioned procedure.

A precise and targeted weed control would bring about positive consequences from both environmental and economic perspectives. Given the small spectral differences between crop species, VNIR hyperspectral data can be a powerful tool to perform an effective weed monitoring and identification when high spatial and spectral resolution data is available (i.e. UAV platforms).This work explores the spectral differences between crops and weeds to evaluate the ability of UAV hyperspectral data to separate maize crop from weeds and to discriminate different types of weeds. To this aim, UAV and field hyperspectral data were acquired in some maize fields in Italy during the 2016 growing season. Results showed that by exploiting leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, retrieved using spectral indices or by inverting PROSAIL, is it possible to discriminate between maize crop and weeds and, moreover, among weed types.

When collecting LiDAR from an aircraft, the navigation system accuracy must exceed the LiDAR accuracy to properly reference returns in 3-D space. Precision navigation systems can be expensive and often require full-scale aircraft to house such systems. Synchronizing the LiDAR sensor and a camera, using a texel camera calibration, provides additional information that reduces the need for precision navigation equipment. This paper describes a bundle adjustment technique for aerial texel images that allows for relatively low-accuracy navigation systems to be used with low-cost LiDAR and camera data to form higher fidelity terrain models. The bundle adjustment objective function utilizes matching image points, measured LiDAR distances, and the texel camera calibration and does not require overlapping LiDAR scans or ground control points. The utility of this method is proven using a simulated texel camera and unmanned aerial system (UAS) flight data created from aerial photographs and elevation data. A small UAS is chosen as the target vehicle due to its relatively inexpensive hardware and operating costs, illustrating the power of this method in accurately referencing the LiDAR and camera data.

To improve the accuracy, ancillary data in the form of low-cost, high-resolution field scans could be used for inferring statistical measures for devising the high-cost sampling plan. The current study targets algorithmically-guided sampling plans using available ancillary data. We propose possible models for quantifying spatial coverage and diversity concerning the ancillary data. We investigate models as objective functions, devise Pareto optimization problems and solve them using NSGA-II. We analyzed the obtained sampling plans in an agricultural field, and suggest statistical tools for sample-size determination and plans' ranking according to additional information criteria. We argue that our approach is successful in attaining a practical sampling plan, constituting a fine trade-off between objectives, and possessing no discrepancies.",2019,5,0,10.1145/3321707.3321809,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c644dee5cede4db5ed173d17989463dc0e2440e,"Book,JournalArticle,Conference",Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation
5bbbc6709d78fda3048be73cf4049754ed1b5d1f,Position-Based Beamforming Design for UAV Communications in LTE Networks,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in many real-world applications such as remote sensing, emergency medicine delivery and precision agriculture. LTE networks are regarded as key candidates to offer high performance broadband wireless services to support UAV applications and safe deployment. However, the unique features of aerial UAVs including high-altitude manipulation, three-dimension (3D) mobility and rapid velocity changes, pose challenging issues for optimising LTE wireless communications to support UAVs, especially under the severe inter-cell interference generated by UAVs in the sky. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel position-based robust beamforming algorithm to improve the performance of LTE networks to serve UAVs. For obtaining optimal weight vectors that could tolerate Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation errors, we propose a hybrid method to integrate the channel information and UAV flight information to accurately estimate the DoA angle range. In order to validate the performance of the proposed robust beamforming algorithm, we conduct comprehensive simulation experiments under practical configurations. The results show that the proposed robust beamforming algorithm outperforms benchmark Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamforming and GPS-based beamforming algorithms.",2019,13,0,10.1109/ICC.2019.8761505,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5bbbc6709d78fda3048be73cf4049754ed1b5d1f,"JournalArticle,Conference",ICC 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)

2ee59c256d0b13695d3fe9ef4f361a4747bc8b98,"Prediction of Soil Organic Carbon based on Landsat 8 Monthly NDVI Data for the Jianghan Plain in Hubei Province, China","High-precision maps of soil organic carbon (SOC) are beneficial for managing soil fertility and understanding the global carbon cycle. Digital soil mapping plays an important role in efficiently obtaining the spatial distribution of SOC, which contributes to precision agriculture. However, traditional soil-forming factors (i.e., terrain or climatic factors) have weak variability in low-relief areas, such as plains, and cannot reflect the spatial variation of soil attributes. Meanwhile, vegetation cover hinders the acquisition of the direct information of farmland soil. Thus, useful environmental variables should be utilized for SOC prediction and the digital mapping of such areas. SOC has an important effect on crop growth status, and remote sensing data can record the apparent spectral characteristics of crops. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is an important index reflecting crop growth and biomass. This study used NDVI time series data rather than traditional soil-forming factors to map SOC. Honghu City, located in the middle of the Jianghan Plain, was selected as the study region, and the NDVI time series data extracted from Landsat 8 were used as the auxiliary variables. SOC maps were estimated through stepwise linear regression (SLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). Ordinary kriging (OK) was used as the reference model, while root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and coefficient of determination of prediction (R2P) were used to evaluate the model performance. Results showed that SOC had a significant positive correlation in July and August (0.17, 0.29) and a significant negative correlation in January, April, and December (−0.23, −0.27, and −0.23) with NDVI time series data. The best model for SOC prediction was generated by ANN, with the lowest RMSEP of 3.718 and highest R2P of 0.391, followed by SVM (RMSEP = 3.753, R2P = 0.361) and PLSR (RMSEP = 4.087, R2P = 0.283). The SLR model was the worst model, with the lowest R2P of 0.281 and highest RMSEP of 3.930. ANN and SVM were better than OK (RMSEP = 3.727, R2P = 0.372), whereas PLSR and SLR were worse than OK. Moreover, the prediction results using single-data NDVI or short time series NDVI showed low accuracy. The effect of the terrain factor on SOC prediction represented unsatisfactory results. All these results indicated that the NDVI time series data can be used for SOC mapping in plain areas and that the ANN model can maximally extract additional associated information between NDVI time series data and SOC. This study presented an effective method to overcome the selection of auxiliary variables for digital soil mapping in plain areas when the soil was covered with vegetation. This finding indicated that the time series characteristics of NDVI were conducive for predicting SOC in plains.",2019,118,5,10.3390/RS11141683,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ee59c256d0b13695d3fe9ef4f361a4747bc8b98,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

Numerically, this problem is solved separately for each biophysical parameter such as leaf area index, soil moisture, crop height and etc. However, this approach ignores tight relationship among the biophysical parameters, which is essential for driving estimation performance with a limited number of in-situ measurements. As an alternative strategy, a multi-output regression, which also learns the relationship among biophysical parameters in the regression model, is considered. In order to see how multi-output regression models capture the plausible physical relationship between crops biophysical parameters and polarimetric features, RadarSAT-2 images acquired over agriculture fields in the context of the AgriSAR 2009 campaign were used. Specifically, multioutput Gaussian Processes and multi-output Support Vector Machines, which are two powerful kernel-based methods, are implemented and assessed in the context of accuracy assessment of the biophysical parameter estimation.",2019,0,0,10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820646,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/869f2ee7821cef98c0c059972246fe1ea1545c2c,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics
bccdee20e4bec044ac4f31b15f082ea956f88be2,Application and Research Progress of Geographic Information System (GIS) in Agriculture,"The application of Geographic Information System (GIS) in agriculture is a new and important research field in agricultural science. This paper first introduces the evolution of GIS technology. As the third generation language of geography, GIS is a comprehensive application system developed in the last 50 years. Internationally, GIS began to be used in agriculture in the 1970s. It has been applied in land resource survey, land resource evaluation, and management analysis of agricultural resource information. After the 1990s, the application of GIS in the field of agriculture has been deepened and popularized. It is mainly used in the followings, such as the regional agricultural sustainable development research, land crop suitability evaluation, agricultural production information management, farmland soil erosion and protection research, land agricultural productive potential research, agricultural system imitation and simulation research, integrated of modern high-tech “precision agriculture” research and application, agro-ecosystem monitoring and quantitative research, investigation, planning and management of farmland and agricultural input-output benefits and environmental protection research, forest pest control, etc. In China, in the mid-1980s, GIS began to be applied to the agricultural field including land and resources decision management, agricultural resource information, regional agricultural planning, grain distribution management and food production assisted decision-making, agricultural production potential research, crop yield estimation research, regional agricultural sustainable development research, agricultural land suitability evaluation, agro-ecological environment monitoring, and research on precision agricultural information processing systems based on GPS and GIS, which have made great achievements. Some research results have been directly applied to agricultural production and great economic benefits have been obtained. This paper focuses on the specific application research of GIS technology on agricultural resource information management, agroclimatic zoning, agricultural disaster prevention, agro-ecological environment management, precision agriculture, crop yield estimation and monitoring, soil erosion, ecological sensitivity and non-point source pollution, etc. The research believes that the application of “3S” integration technology, the integration of integrated agricultural expert system (ES) combined with GIS, and the application of portable mobile GIS are the main trend of modern agriculture development of GIS technology under the background of today’s informatization and networking.",2019,22,0,10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820476,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bccdee20e4bec044ac4f31b15f082ea956f88be2,"JournalArticle,Conference,Review",International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics

Despite extensive research, the research-to-commercial transfer rate of abiotic stress-resistant crops remains very low. This is mainly due to the complexity of genotype × environment interactions and in particular, the ability to quantify the dynamic plant physiological response profile to a dynamic environment. Most existing phenotyping facilities collect information using robotics and automated image acquisition and analysis. However, their ability to directly measure the physiological properties of the whole plant is limited. We demonstrate a high-throughput functional phenotyping system (HFPS) that enables comparing plants’ dynamic responses to different ambient conditions in dynamic environments due to its direct and simultaneous measurement of yield-related physiological traits of plants under several treatments. The system is designed as one-to-one (1:1) plant–[sensors+controller] units, i.e., each individual plant has its own personalized sensor, controller and irrigation valves that enable (i) monitoring water-relation kinetics of each plant–environment response throughout the plant’s life cycle with high spatiotemporal resolution, (ii) a truly randomized experimental design due to multiple independent treatment scenarios for every plant, and (iii) reduction of artificial ambient perturbations due to the immobility of the plants or other objects. In addition, we propose two new resilience-quantifying-related traits that can also be phenotyped using the HFPS: transpiration recovery rate and night water reabsorption. We use the HFPS to screen the effects of two commercial biostimulants (a seaweed extract –ICL-SW, and a metabolite formula – ICL-NewFo1) on Capsicum annuum under different irrigation regimes. Biostimulants are considered an alternative approach to improving crop productivity. However, their complex mode of action necessitates cost-effective pre-field phenotyping. The combination of two types of treatment (biostimulants and drought) enabled us to evaluate the precision and resolution of the system in investigating the effect of biostimulants on drought tolerance. We analyze and discuss plant behavior at different stages, and assess the penalty and trade-off between productivity and resilience. In this test case, we suggest a protocol for the screening of biostimulants’ physiological mechanisms of action.",2019,67,1,10.3389/fpls.2019.00905,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/43ae7538b8c45b9505bbc70184a9a23ac43577c3,JournalArticle,Frontiers in Plant Science
96c65928adb47a09744b05ff0df8fd90190b36fd,A Fast Machine Learning Workflow for Rapid Phenotype Prediction from Whole Shotgun Metagenomes,"Research on the microbiome is an emerging and crucial science that finds many applications in healthcare, food safety, precision agriculture and environmental studies. Huge amounts of DNA from microbial communities are being sequenced and analyzed by scientists interested in extracting meaningful biological information from this big data. Analyzing massive microbiome sequencing datasets, which embed the functions and interactions of thousands of different bacterial, fungal and viral species, is a significant computational challenge. Artificial intelligence has the potential for building predictive models that can provide insights for specific cutting edge applications such as guiding diagnostics and developing personalised treatments, as well as maintaining soil health and fertility. Current machine learning workflows that predict traits of host organisms from their commensal microbiome do not take into account the whole genetic material constituting the microbiome, instead basing the analysis on specific marker genes. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first machine learning workflow that efficiently performs host phenotype prediction from whole shotgun metagenomes by computing similaritypreserving compact representations of the genetic material. Our workflow enables prediction tasks, such as classification and regression, from Terabytes of raw sequencing data that do not necessitate any pre-prossessing through expensive bioinformatics pipelines. We compare the performance in terms of time, accuracy and uncertainty of predictions for four different classifiers. More precisely, we demonstrate that our ML workflow can efficiently classify real data with high accuracy, using examples from dog and human metagenomic studies, representing a step forward towards real time diagnostics and a potential for cloud applications.",2019,10,0,10.1609/AAAI.V33I01.33019434,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96c65928adb47a09744b05ff0df8fd90190b36fd,"JournalArticle,Conference",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence

Earlier estimation of wheat GPC based on remote sensing provided effective decision to adapt optimized strategies for grain harvest, which is of great significance for agricultural production. The objectives of this field study are: (i) To assess the ability of spectral vegetation indices (VIs) of Sentinel 2 data to detect the wheat nitrogen (N) attributes related to the grain quality of winter wheat production, and (ii) to examine the accuracy of wheat N status and GPC estimation models based on different VIs and wheat nitrogen parameters across Analytical Spectra Devices (ASD) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) hyper-spectral data-simulated sentinel data and the real Sentinel-2 data. In this study, four nitrogen parameters at the wheat anthesis stage, including plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA), plant nitrogen content (PNC), leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA), and leaf nitrogen content (LNC), were evaluated for their relationship between spectral parameters and GPC. Then, a multivariate linear regression method was used to establish the wheat nitrogen and GPC estimation model through simulated Sentinel-2A VIs. The coefficients of determination (R2) of four nitrogen parameter models were all greater than 0.7. The minimum R2 of the prediction model of wheat GPC constructed by four nitrogen parameters combined with VIs was 0.428 and the highest R2 was 0.467. The normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of the four nitrogen estimation models ranged from 26.333% to 29.530% when verified by the ground-measured data collected from the Beijing suburbs, and the corresponding nRMSE for the GPC-predicted models ranged from 17.457% to 52.518%. The accuracy of the estimated model was verified by UAV hyper-spectral data which had resized to different spatial resolution collected from the National Experimental Station for Precision Agriculture. The normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of the four nitrogen estimation models ranged from 16.9% to 37.8%, and the corresponding nRMSE for the GPC-predicted models ranged from 12.3% to 13.2%. The relevant models were also verified by Sentinel-2A data collected in 2018 while the minimum nRMSE for GPC invert model based on PNA was 7.89% and the maximum nRMSE of the GPC model based on LNC was 12.46% in Renqiu district, Hebei province. The nRMSE for the wheat nitrogen estimation model ranged from 23.200% to 42.790% for LNC and PNC.

7d1560608c3231509c63b53afa4d445c547dfb8e,Potato Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques and Sentinel 2 Data,"Traditional potato growth models evidence certain limitations, such as the cost of obtaining the input data required to run the models, the lack of spatial information in some instances, or the actual quality of input data. In order to address these issues, we develop a model to predict potato yield using satellite remote sensing. In an effort to offer a good predictive model that improves the state of the art on potato precision agriculture, we use images from the twin Sentinel 2 satellites (European Space Agency—Copernicus Programme) over three growing seasons, applying different machine learning models. First, we fitted nine machine learning algorithms with various pre-processing scenarios using variables from July, August and September based on the red, red-edge and infra-red bands of the spectrum. Second, we selected the best performing models and evaluated them against independent test data. Finally, we repeated the previous two steps using only variables corresponding to July and August. Our results showed that the feature selection step proved vital during data pre-processing in order to reduce multicollinearity among predictors. The Regression Quantile Lasso model (11.67% Root Mean Square Error, RMSE; R2 = 0.88 and 9.18% Mean Absolute Error, MAE) and Leap Backwards model (10.94% RMSE, R2 = 0.89 and 8.95% MAE) performed better when predictors with a correlation coefficient > 0.5 were removed from the dataset. In contrast, the Support Vector Machine Radial (svmRadial) performed better with no feature selection method (11.7% RMSE, R2 = 0.93 and 8.64% MAE). In addition, we used a random forest model to predict potato yields in Castilla y León (Spain) 1–2 months prior to harvest, and obtained satisfactory results (11.16% RMSE, R2 = 0.89 and 8.71% MAE). These results demonstrate the suitability of our models to predict potato yields in the region studied.",2019,146,6,10.3390/RS11151745,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d1560608c3231509c63b53afa4d445c547dfb8e,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing
b08f40a48919f60594cc2478f525fc6e6402a753,A Global Perspective on Integrated Strategies to Manage Soil Phosphorus Status for Eutrophication Control without Limiting Land Productivity.,"Unnecessary accumulation of phosphorus (P) in agricultural soils continues to degrade water quality and linked ecosystem services. Managing both soil loss and soil P fertility status is therefore crucial for eutrophication control, but the relative environmental benefits of these two mitigation measures, and the timescales over which they occur, remain unclear. To support policies toward reduced P loadings from agricultural soils, we examined the impact of soil conservation and lowering of soil test P (STP) in different regions with intensive farming (Europe, the United States, and Australia). Relationships between STP and soluble reactive P concentrations in land runoff suggested that eutrophication control targets would be more achievable if STP concentrations were kept at or below the current recommended threshold values for fertilizer response. Simulations using the Annual P Loss Estimator (APLE) model in three contrasting catchments predicted total P losses ranging from 0.52 to 0.88 kg ha depending on soil P buffering and erosion vulnerability. Drawing down STP in all catchment soils to the threshold optimum for productivity reduced catchment P loss by between 18 and 40%, but this would take between 30 and 40+ years. In one catchment, STP drawdown was more effective in reducing P loss than erosion control, but combining both strategies was always the most effective and more rapid than erosion control alone. By accounting for both soil P buffering interactions and erosion vulnerability, the APLE model quickly provided reliable information on the magnitude and time frame of P loss reduction that can be realistically expected from soil and STP management. Greater precision in the sampling, analysis, and interpretation of STP, and more technical innovation to lower agronomic optimum STP concentrations on farms, is needed to foster long-term sustainable management of soil P fertility in the future.",2019,54,2,10.2134/JEQ2019.03.0131,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b08f40a48919f60594cc2478f525fc6e6402a753,JournalArticle,Journal of Environmental Quality

Accurate determination of micronutrients is important for the improvement of sesame quality and nutrition assessments. Our previous study showed that 10 antioxidants—d-homoproline, vitamin B2, coniferyl aldehyde, hesperidin, phloretin, N-acetyl-l-leucine, l-hyoscyamine, ferulic acid, 5-methoxypsoralen, and 8-methoxypsoralen—in sesame were potential characteristic nutrients in sesame. Herein, simultaneous detection of 10 different types of antioxidants was developed by using ultrasound-assisted extraction coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UAE-LC-MS/MS) with the help of response surface methodology. The significant variables and levels were screened and optimized by combining the single factor experiment, Plackett–Burman test, and Box–Behnken design. The optimal conditions for extraction of target antioxidants in sesame were methanol solution of 75.0%, liquid-to-material ratio of 20:1 (mL/g), extraction temperature of 50 °C, extraction power of 410.0 W, extraction time of 65 min. The total yield of targets was 21.74 μg/g under the optimized conditions. The mobile phase used was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water, and the column was a Thermo Syncronis C18 reverse phase column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 3 μm). All targets required only one injection and could be quickly separated and assayed within 7 min. The limits of detection and limits of quantification for these 10 nutritional compounds ranged from 0.01 to 0.11 µg/kg and from 0.04 to 0.34 µg/kg, respectively. The validation results indicated that the method had reasonable linearity (R2 ≥ 0.9990), good recoveries (71.1%–118.3%), satisfactory intra-day precision (≤9.6%) and inter-day precision (≤12.9%), and negligible matrix effects (≤13.8%).

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with global navigation satellite systems/inertial navigation systems (GNSS/INS) and consumer-grade digital imaging sensors are capable of providing accurate 3D spatial information at a relatively low cost. However, with the use of consumer-grade sensors, system calibration is critical for accurate 3D reconstruction. In this study, ‘consumer-grade’ refers to cameras that require system calibration by the user instead of by the manufacturer or other high-end laboratory settings, as well as relatively low-cost GNSS/INS units. In addition to classical spatial system calibration, many consumer-grade sensors also need temporal calibration for accurate 3D reconstruction. This study examines the accuracy impact of time delay in the synchronization between the GNSS/INS unit and cameras on-board UAV-based mapping systems. After reviewing existing strategies, this study presents two approaches (direct and indirect) to correct for time delay between GNSS/INS recorded event markers and actual time of image exposure. Our results show that both approaches are capable of handling and correcting this time delay, with the direct approach being more rigorous. When a time delay exists and the direct or indirect approach is applied, horizontal accuracy of 1–3 times the ground sampling distance (GSD) can be achieved without either the use of any ground control points (GCPs) or adjusting the original GNSS/INS trajectory information.",2019,23,1,10.3390/RS11151811,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8dfb0920938776af5a56219f1f6176798c81416d,"JournalArticle,Review",Remote Sensing

b1ffe089ffb212860b9c5cd0880f36e4d0758519,An Overlapping-Free Leaf Segmentation Method for Plant Point Clouds,"Automatic leaf segmentation, as well as identification and classification methods that built upon it, are able to provide immediate monitoring for plant growth status to guarantee the output. Although 3D plant point clouds contain abundant phenotypic features, plant leaves are usually distributed in clusters and are sometimes seriously overlapped in the canopy. Therefore, it is still a big challenge to automatically segment each individual leaf from a highly crowded plant canopy in 3D for plant phenotyping purposes. In this work, we propose an overlapping-free individual leaf segmentation method for plant point clouds using the 3D filtering and facet region growing. In order to separate leaves with different overlapping situations, we develop a new 3D joint filtering operator, which integrates a Radius-based Outlier Filter (RBOF) and a Surface Boundary Filter (SBF) to help to separate occluded leaves. By introducing the facet over-segmentation and facet-based region growing, the noise in segmentation is suppressed and labeled leaf centers can expand to their whole leaves, respectively. Our method can work on point clouds generated from three types of 3D imaging platforms, and also suitable for different kinds of plant species. In experiments, it obtains a point-level cover rate of 97% for Epipremnum aureum, 99% for Monstera deliciosa, 99% for Calathea makoyana, and 87% for Hedera nepalensis sample plants. At the leaf level, our method reaches an average Recall at 100.00%, a Precision at 99.33%, and an average F-measure at 99.66%, respectively. The proposed method can also facilitate the automatic traits estimation of each single leaf (such as the leaf area, length, and width), which has potential to become a highly effective tool for plant research and agricultural engineering.",2019,38,2,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940385,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b1ffe089ffb212860b9c5cd0880f36e4d0758519,JournalArticle,IEEE Access

Data collection from these networks is often challenging, as they may be deployed in remote regions where existing backhaul infrastructure is expensive or absent. With the commercial and industrial success of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), there is understandable interest in using UASs for delay tolerant data collection from 802.15.4 IoT sensor networks. In this study, we investigate how to optimize 802.15.4 networks for aerial data collection, which, unlike other wireless standards, has not received rigorous evaluation for three-dimensional aerial communication. We analyze experimental measurements from an outdoor aerial testbed, examining how factors, such as antenna orientation, altitude, antenna placement, and obstruction, affect signal strength and packet reception rate. In our analysis, we model and predict the quality of service for aerial data collection, based on these network configuration variables, and contrast that with the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI)—a commonly used signal strength metric. We find that network configuration plays a significant role in network quality, which RSSI, a mediator variable, struggles to account for in the presence of high packet loss.

We used DHT11, YL-100, and LDR sensor to monitor air temperature and humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity respectively. We generated fifty-four fuzzy rules to determine our water pump state that act as the irrigation system. Three different membership function was used.

Second, Gaussian-curve membership function was used to represent the second fuzzy class within three parameters (air temperature, air humidity, and soil moisture), last, the fuzzy class was represented by an S-curve membership function. Our fuzzy classification result was represented by Z-curve and S-curve membership function. However, this produces a crisp classification. Therefore, we applied the defuzzification class threshold of t = 0.55 as our Best Classification Result.

Genomics and machine learning methods are being increasingly used to analyze and predict AMR. This type of surveillance is very important to try to reduce the impact of AMR. Machine learning models are typically trained using genomic data, but the aspects of the genomes that they use to make predictions are rarely analyzed. In this work, we showed how, by using different types of machine learning models and performing this analysis, it is possible to identify the key genes underlying AMR in nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS). NTS is among the leading cause of foodborne illness globally; however, AMR in NTS has not been heavily studied within the food chain itself. Therefore, in this work we performed a broad-scale analysis of the AMR in NTS isolates from commercial chicken farms and identified some priority AMR genes for surveillance. ABSTRACT Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) is a leading global cause of bacterial foodborne morbidity and mortality. Our ability to treat severe NTS infections has been impaired by increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To understand and mitigate the global health crisis AMR represents, we need to link the observed resistance phenotypes with their underlying genomic mechanisms. Broiler chickens represent a key reservoir and vector for NTS infections, but isolates from this setting have been characterized in only very low numbers relative to clinical isolates. In this study, we sequenced and assembled 97 genomes encompassing 7 serotypes isolated from broiler chicken in farms in British Columbia between 2005 and 2008. Through application of machine learning (ML) models to predict the observed AMR phenotype from this genomic data, we were able to generate highly (0.92 to 0.99) precise logistic regression models using known AMR gene annotations as features for 7 antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, streptomycin, and tetracycline). Similarly, we also trained “reference-free” k-mer-based set-covering machine phenotypic prediction models (0.91 to 1.0 precision) for these antibiotics. By combining the inferred k-mers and logistic regression weights, we identified the primary drivers of AMR for the 7 studied antibiotics in these isolates. With our research representing one of the largest studies of a diverse set of NTS isolates from broiler chicken, we can thus confirm that the AmpC-like CMY-2 β-lactamase is a primary driver of β-lactam resistance and that the phosphotransferases APH(6)-Id and APH(3″-Ib) are the principal drivers of streptomycin resistance in this important ecosystem.

This study reveals that chicken manure was the best substrate for SCP production by submerged fermentation using photosynthetic bacteria compared to swine, cow, and buffalo manure. Regression analysis showed that the productions were found to be significantly influenced by chicken manure content, inoculum size, and cultivation time. Response surface methodology based on central composite design generated the optimal condition (15% chicken manure, 30% inoculum size and cultivation time for 14 days) at which biomass, protein, and carotenoid productions were increased by 92.3%, 21.6%, and 18.2%, respectively. The percentage of error between the predicted and actual values for biomass, protein, and carotenoid productions were 1.56%, 2.64%, and 2.09%, respectively, which indicates the precision of the model. To verify the quality of SCP, the bacterium was cultured in a photobioreactor to investigate amino acid composition, protein, and nucleic acid contents. The SCP yielded 62.7% protein with essential amino acids including lysine, methionine, threonine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, histidine, and low nucleic acid content of 4.52%.

They have the advantage of being natural transformations of hyper-spectral or multi-spectral images that filter the data stream into a neural network, while reducing training requirements and increasing system classification performance. In this paper, to calculate a detailed crop/soil segmentation based on high resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM) data, we propose the redefinition of the radiometric index using a directional mathematical filter. To further refine the analysis, we feed this new radiometric index image of about 3500 × 4500 pixels into a relatively small Convolution Neural Network (CNN) designed for general image pattern recognition at 28 × 28 pixels to evaluate and resolve the vegetation correctly. We show that the result of applying a DSM filter to the NDVI radiometric index before feeding it into a Convolutional Neural Network can potentially improve crop separation hit rate by 65%.",2019,60,1,10.3390/rs11161859,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04cad3d865b574530ffcbe61f89393e73e01fb0a,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

Utilization of water is also an important criterion for a good agriculture and high production. The new dimension of smart farming in agriculture is Internet of Things. The IoT is a best solution for smart agriculture due to the use of interoperable, pervasive, scalable and open technologies and gained momentum in the field of agriculture. The advanced growth in IoT technologies even made the dream come true with the connectivity reached to rural areas. The use of highly accurate IoT sensors can measure the environmental context of farms and helps in improving the accuracy of precision agriculture. This paper reviews the various applications of IoT motivated by a purpose to identify various areas with latest trends, architecture frameworks.

20c711a665154b3caaa73524f5f1e39a58a12fbb,Robust joint stem detection and crop‐weed classification using image sequences for plant‐specific treatment in precision farming,"Conventional farming still relies on large quantities of agrochemicals for weed management which have several negative side‐effects on the environment. Autonomous robots offer the potential to reduce the amount of chemicals applied, as robots can monitor and treat each plant in the field individually and thereby circumventing the uniform chemical treatment of the whole field. Such agricultural robots need the ability to identify individual crops and weeds in the field using sensor data and must additionally select effective treatment methods based on the type of weed. For example, certain types of weeds can only be effectively treated mechanically due to their resistance to herbicides, whereas other types can be treated trough selective spraying. In this article, we present a novel system that provides the necessary information for effective plant‐specific treatment. It estimates the stem location for weeds, which enables the robots to perform precise mechanical treatment, and at the same time provides the pixel‐accurate area covered by weeds for treatment through selective spraying. The major challenge in developing such a system is the large variability in the visual appearance that occurs in different fields. Thus, an effective classification system has to robustly handle substantial environmental changes including varying weed pressure, various weed types, different growth stages, changing visual appearance of the plants and the soil. Our approach uses an end‐to‐end trainable fully convolutional network that simultaneously estimates plant stem positions as well as the spatial extent of crop plants and weeds. It jointly learns how to detect the stems and the pixel‐wise semantic segmentation and incorporates spatial information by considering image sequences of local field strips. The jointly learned feature representation for both tasks furthermore exploits the crop arrangement information that is often present in crop fields. This information is considered even if it is only observable from the image sequences and not a single image. Such image sequences, as typically provided by robots navigating over the field along crop rows, enable our approach to robustly estimate the semantic segmentation and stem positions despite the large variations encountered in different fields. We implemented and thoroughly tested our approach on images from multiple farms in different countries. The experiments show that our system generalizes well to previously unseen fields under varying environmental conditions—a key capability to deploy such systems in the real world. Compared to state‐of‐the‐art approaches, our approach generalizes well to unseen fields and not only substantially improves the stem detection accuracy, that is, distinguishing crop and weed stems, but also improves the semantic segmentation performance.",2019,80,1,10.1002/rob.21901,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20c711a665154b3caaa73524f5f1e39a58a12fbb,JournalArticle,J.

459fb34df48133ef56e9a035ec7bffa5f5a92dac,Health Impacts of Perchlorate and Pesticide Exposure: Protocol for Community-Engaged Research to Evaluate Environmental Toxicants in a US Border Community,"Background The Northern Arizona University (NAU) Center for Health Equity Research (CHER) is conducting community-engaged health research involving “environmental scans” in Yuma County in collaboration with community health stakeholders, including the Yuma Regional Medical Center (YRMC), Regional Center for Border Health, Inc. (RCBH), Campesinos Sin Fronteras (CSF), Yuma County Public Health District, and government agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) working on border health issues. The purpose of these efforts is to address community-generated environmental health hazards identified through ongoing coalitions among NAU, and local health care and research institutions. Objective We are undertaking joint community/university efforts to examine human exposures to perchlorate and agricultural pesticides. This project also includes the parallel development of a new animal model for investigating the mechanisms of toxicity following a “one health” approach. The ultimate goal of this community-engaged effort is to develop interventions to reduce exposures and health impacts of contaminants in Yuma populations. Methods All participants completed the informed consent process, which included information on the purpose of the study, a request for access to health histories and medical records, and interviews. The interview included questions related to (1) demographics, (2) social determinants of health, (3) health screening, (4) occupational and environmental exposures to perchlorate and pesticides, and (5) access to health services. Each participant provided a hair sample for quantifying the metals used in pesticides, urine sample for perchlorate quantification, and blood sample for endocrine assays. Modeling will examine the relationships between the concentrations of contaminants and hormones, demographics and social determinants of health, and health status of the study population, including health markers known to be impacted by perchlorate and pesticides. Results We recruited 323 adults residing in Yuma County during a 1-year pilot/feasibility study. Among these, 147 residents were patients from either YRMC or RCBH with a primary diagnosis of thyroid disease, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroid cancer, or goiter. The remaining 176 participants were from the general population but with no history of thyroid disorder. The pilot study confirmed the feasibility of using the identified community-engaged protocol to recruit, consent, and collect data from a difficult-to-access, vulnerable population. The demographics of the pilot study population and positive feedback on the success of the community-engaged approach indicate that the project can be scaled up to a broader study with replicable population health findings. Conclusions Using a community-engaged approach, the research protocol provided substantial evidence regarding the effectiveness of designing and implementing culturally relevant recruitment and dissemination processes that combine laboratory findings and public health information. Future findings will elucidate the mechanisms of toxicity and the population health effects of the contaminants of concern, as well as provide a new animal model to develop precision medicine capabilities for the population.

Optical imagery can provide invaluable insights into crop growth and development but is severely hampered by cloud cover. This case study in the Flevopolder illustrates the potential value of Sentinel-1 for monitoring five key crops in The Netherlands, namely sugar beet, potato, maize, wheat and English rye grass. Time series of radar backscatter from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 Mission are analyzed and compared to ground measurements including phenological stage and height. Temporal variations in backscatter data reflect changes in water content and structure associated with phenological development. Emergence and closure dates are estimated from the backscatter time series and validated against a photo archive. Coherence data are compared to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and ground data, illustrating that the sudden increase in coherence is a useful indicator of harvest. The results presented here demonstrate that Sentinel-1 data have significant potential value to monitor growth and development of key Dutch crops. Furthermore, the guaranteed availability of Sentinel-1 imagery in clouded conditions ensures the reliability of data to meet the monitoring needs of farmers, food producers and regulatory bodies.",2019,165,9,10.3390/RS11161887,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ccbb73e2214e3edb9b7beac7aa27ce411e3bb6fc,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

Rapid and accurate acquisition of this data was always an important issue. The land use/cover data and the DMSP/OLS nighttime light (NTL) data both had been used to simulate GDP spatialization. By analyzing previous researches, the estimated method based on land use/cover data, estimated method based on radiance-calibrated NTL data and estimated method based on land use/cover data and radiance-calibrated NTL data were applied and compared in this study.

79a336868a073bc9766124cce090519b4f8c2230,Long‐duration fully autonomous operation of rotorcraft unmanned aerial systems for remote‐sensing data acquisition,"Recent applications of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to precision agriculture have shown increased ease and efficiency in data collection at precise remote locations. However, further enhancement of the field requires operation over long periods of time, for example, days or weeks. This has so far been impractical due to the limited flight times of such platforms and the requirement of humans in the loop for operation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fully autonomous rotorcraft UAS that is capable of performing repeated flights for long‐term observation missions without any human intervention. We address two key technologies that are critical for such a system: full platform autonomy to enable mission execution independently from human operators and the ability of vision‐based precision landing on a recharging station for automated energy replenishment. High‐level autonomous decision making is implemented as a hierarchy of master and slave state machines. Vision‐based precision landing is enabled by estimating the landing pad's pose using a bundle of AprilTag fiducials configured for detection from a wide range of altitudes. We provide an extensive evaluation of the landing pad pose estimation accuracy as a function of the bundle's geometry. The functionality of the complete system is demonstrated through two indoor experiments with duration of 11 and 10.6 hr, and one outdoor experiment with a duration of 4 hr. The UAS executed 16, 48, and 22 flights, respectively, during these experiments. In the outdoor experiment, the ratio between flying to collect data and charging was 1–10, which is similar to past work in this domain. All flights were fully autonomous with no human in the loop. To our best knowledge, this is the first research publication about the long‐term outdoor operation of a quadrotor system with no human interaction.",2019,53,4,10.1002/rob.21898,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/79a336868a073bc9766124cce090519b4f8c2230,JournalArticle,J.

c400f2f4b570f8d82bd429d2799ff3ae7faa9e17,Performance Analysis of Multi-Hop Broadcast Protocols for Distributed UAV Formation Control Applications,"Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) systems have become popular in applications such as precision agriculture, remote sensing, and pollution monitoring. Commonly, multi-UAV systems require to reach and maintain a specific flight formation during mission execution. This can be achieved by using a distributed UAV formation control strategy in which each UAV has a flight controller whose function is to calculate the control actions for the UAV actuators such that the UAV formation is maintained. To perform this task, the control strategy requires the reliable and timely exchange of information within the UAV formation. The information that is needed by the controller is commonly referred to as state information (SI). It has been assumed that SI can be properly disseminated by means of multi-hop communications, i.e., by deploying a flying ad-hoc network (FANET). In this sense, multi-hop broadcast protocols (MBPs) that were previously proposed for mobile and vehicular ad-hoc networks seem to be suited for this task. However, previous work dealing with distributed UAV formation control has made communication and networking assumptions that would be hard to fulfill in actual FANET deployments. Moreover, the efficiency of the MBPs to disseminate SI within a FANET remains unexplored. The goal of this paper is to analyze how the network performance offered by different MBPs impacts the effectiveness of distributed UAV formation control to maintain UAV formation. An evaluation framework to perform this task is proposed in this paper. The simulation results demonstrate the relevance of MBP performance in SI message dissemination and thus in the ability of the controller to maintain a formation.",2019,6,0,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2935307,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c400f2f4b570f8d82bd429d2799ff3ae7faa9e17,JournalArticle,IEEE Access
2fefbf649b57478bdfd2b5d795ce6f728da5f5b0,Modern problems of digitalization of agricultural production,"At the present stage, the most promising form of digitalization of production and management in agriculture is the formation of an integrated digital production complex as an organic merger of technical means of digitalization of production on the basis of precision farming, artificial intelligence management, as well as information and analytical management system. The availability of such a powerful tool as an information and analytical system as part of an integrated digital production complex in combination with the most digitized production processes can simultaneously meet modern requirements for increasing productivity and reducing costs for the production of agricultural products and food, and a sharp increase in the quality of products. It is argued that the functioning of information and analytical systems in some large agricultural formations of the Republic of Tatarstan has provided a qualitative leap in the development of methods and means of digitalization of production and management. It became possible to integrate automated controls up to the level of agro-technological management without a gap between the organizational, economic and agro-technological levels.

d675d37495c37086c38e6d9e08f5cca69efa2630,Recognition pest by image-based transfer learning.,"BACKGROUND
Plant pests mainly refers to insects and mites that harm crops and products. There are a wide variety of plant pests, with wide distribution, fast reproduction and large quantity, which directly causes serious losses to crops. Therefore, pest recognition is very important for crops to grow healthily, and this in turn affects crop yields and quality. At present, it is a great challenge to realize accurate and reliable pest identification.


RESULTS
In this study, we put forward a diagnostic system based on transfer learning for pest detection and recognition. This method is able to train and test ten types of pests and achieves an accuracy of 93.84%. We compared this transfer learning method with human experts and a traditional neural network model. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to human experts and the traditional neural network. To verify the general adaptability of this model, we used our model to recognize two types of weeds: Sisymbrium sophia and Procumbent Speedwell, and achieved an accuracy of 98.92%.


CONCLUSION
The proposed method can provide evidence for the control of pests and weeds and the precise spraying of pesticides. Thus, it provides reliable technical support for precision agriculture. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.",2019,119,10,10.1002/jsfa.9689,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d675d37495c37086c38e6d9e08f5cca69efa2630,JournalArticle,The Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture

While those pilots have demonstrated the viability of community sensing with mobile phones to collect massive amounts of real-time data all year round, to compliment low-resourced agricultural expert surveys, they are limited in generalising ideas for scaled implementations of a community sensing system with farmer communities. This work presents a case of scaled deployment of the mobile ad hoc surveillance for crowdsourcing real-time surveillance data on cassava from over 175 smallholder farmers across Uganda. This paper describes a modified mobile ad hoc surveillance ecosystem to suite smallholder farmer agents, a communication model and data collection model designed to cover the spatial interests for the scale of surveillance, a deployment plan, the training methodology and incentives structure. The paper also presents very early results of contributions from farmer agents, that could be usable in monitoring the movement of planting materials between districts, mapping cassava varieties, multiplication sites, and communities with little or no access to agricultural extension services, and possibly guide precision expert surveys in areas of high disease incidence.",2019,3,0,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5234508dc2e37878695f6694bba0c2aa162f021d,"JournalArticle,Review",arXiv.org
421b1e1e6dd58aa815d6f5c512f294680eb14b8d,Remote Sensing-Guided Sampling Design with Both Good Spatial Coverage and Feature Space Coverage for Accurate Farm Field-Level Soil Mapping,"With the increasing requirements of precision agriculture for massive and various kinds of data, remote sensing technology has become indispensable in acquiring the necessary data for precision agriculture. Understanding the spatial variability of a target soil variable (i.e., soil mapping) is a critical issue in solving many agricultural problems. Field sampling is one of the most commonly used technologies for soil mapping, but sample sizes are restricted by resources, such as field labor, soil physicochemical analysis, and funding. In this paper, we proposed a sampling design method with both good spatial coverage and feature space coverage to achieve more precise spatial variability of farm field-level target soil variables for limited sample sizes. The proposed method used the super-grid to achieve good spatial coverage, and it took advantage of remote sensing products that were highly correlated with the target soil property (SOM content) to achieve good feature space coverage. For the experiments, we employed the ordinary kriging (OK) method to map the soil organic matter (SOM) content. The different sized super-grid comparison experiments showed that the 400 × 400 m2 super-grid had the highest SOM content mapping accuracy. Then, we compared the proposed method to regular grid sampling (good spatial coverage) and k-means sampling (good feature space coverage), and the experimental results indicated that the proposed method had greater potential in the selection of representative samples that could improve the SOM content mapping accuracy.",2019,4,0,10.3390/RS11161946,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/421b1e1e6dd58aa815d6f5c512f294680eb14b8d,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

aa1bb0201dcf409eafd5862a0d30c68c02fca4e5,Plant disease identification using explainable 3D deep learning on hyperspectral images,"Hyperspectral imaging is emerging as a promising approach for plant disease identification. The large and possibly redundant information contained in hyperspectral data cubes makes deep learning based identification of plant diseases a natural fit. Here, we deploy a novel 3D deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) that directly assimilates the hyperspectral data. Furthermore, we interrogate the learnt model to produce physiologically meaningful explanations. We focus on an economically important disease, charcoal rot, which is a soil borne fungal disease that affects the yield of soybean crops worldwide. Based on hyperspectral imaging of inoculated and mock-inoculated stem images, our 3D DCNN has a classification accuracy of 95.73% and an infected class F1 score of 0.87. Using the concept of a saliency map, we visualize the most sensitive pixel locations, and show that the spatial regions with visible disease symptoms are overwhelmingly chosen by the model for classification. We also find that the most sensitive wavelengths used by the model for classification are in the near infrared region (NIR), which is also the commonly used spectral range for determining the vegetative health of a plant. The use of an explainable deep learning model not only provides high accuracy, but also provides physiological insight into model predictions, thus generating confidence in model predictions.

Since many decades’ farmers faced declining agricultural prices and low prices in developing countries. Therefore, in these countries agricultural price policies are under closer appraisal.  Government and policy makers worry about inflation. Economic precision is required in determining prices. This understanding led to conception of the study. The specific objectives are to review various agricultural price theories, research evidences and construct the theory of agricultural price bubble and crash and their effect on macro economy and suggest measures to improve. The study reviews various agricultural price theories, concepts, policies, research gaps and do meta-analysis and formulated the theory of Agricultural prices bubble and price crash. Since 1950, many development economists and practitioners prophesy in developing countries is that low agricultural commodities prices discourage poverty alleviation. Many countries are unable to make successful pricing policies due to there is not enough operative methodological and theoretical support for decision-making. According to the economic theory of cooperativism, the entities come closer to the pecking order theory. Unexpected changes and changes in regulations can have significant impact on the profitability of farming activities. “Demand channel"" is the crucial factor in elucidation of commodity price growth. Future prices moments in agriculture have fat-tailed distributions and display quick and unpredicted price jumps. World Trade Organization study highlights the importance of strengthening multilateral disciplines on both import and export trade interventions to food price fluctuations to reduce beggar-thy-neighbor unilateral trade policy. The theory of NAFTA regionalism did not lead to regionalization and not increasing share of intraregional international trade. In EU countries land rents in modern agriculture causing upward trend in agricultural land prices. Information friction, agricultural supports, agricultural price & trade policies, agricultural price transmission are responsible price fluctuations. In economic theory, asymmetric price transmission has been the subject of considerable attention in agricultural gaps. Selection of forecasting models are based on chaos theory. Chaos in agricultural wholesale price data provides a good theoretical basis for selecting forecasting models. This theory can be applied to agricultural prices forecasting.

6dbe3ed01a99b26b3dc5047f9942253aed9a3ab6,Integrated edge detection and terrain analysis for agricultural terrace delineation from remote sensing images,"ABSTRACT Agricultural terraces are important for agricultural production and soil-and-water conservation. They comprise treads and risers that require manual construction and maintenance. If managed improperly, risers will collapse, causing soil loss, gully erosion, and cultivation threats. However, mapping terrace risers remains a challenge. This study presents a novel approach to automatically map terrace risers by combining remote sensing images and digital elevation models (DEMs). First, a terraced hillslope was extracted via a hill-shading method and edges in the image were detected using a Canny edge detector. Next, the DEM was used to generate the contour direction, and edges along this direction were searched and coded as candidate terrace risers via directional detection. Finally, the results of directional detection and the edge image obtained from the Canny detector were overlaid to backtrack complete terrace risers. The approach was validated using four study areas with different topographic characteristics in the Loess Plateau, China. The results verify that the approach achieves outstanding performance and robustness in mapping terrace risers. The precision, recall, and F-measure were 90.81%–97.57%, 88.53%–94.10%, and 90.13%–95.80%, respectively.

Improved spatial data and monitoring systems are enabling researchers to identify drivers of deforestation with increased geographical precision (1) and to assess the relative potential of various interventions to stem forest loss (2). International initiatives currently focus on halting the expansion of commercial agriculture for export markets, a driver of deforestation that emerged in the 1980s (3). Numerous corporations are trying to implement commitments to remove deforestation from their commodity supply chains. However, recent research shows that the drivers of deforestation are complex and can change rapidly.

Here, we develop new and rapid protocols for Oxford Nanopore MinION-based third-generation diagnostics of plant pathogens that greatly improve the speed of diagnostics. However, due to high error rate and technical biases in MinION, the Pacific BioSciences Sequel platform is more useful for in-depth amplicon-based biodiversity monitoring (metabarcoding) from complex environmental samples. ABSTRACT Culture-based molecular identification methods have revolutionized detection of pathogens, yet these methods are slow and may yield inconclusive results from environmental materials. The second-generation sequencing tools have much-improved precision and sensitivity of detection, but these analyses are costly and may take several days to months. Of the third-generation sequencing techniques, the portable MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) has received much attention because of its small size and possibility of rapid analysis at reasonable cost. Here, we compare the relative performances of two third-generation sequencing instruments, MinION and Sequel (Pacific Biosciences), in identification and diagnostics of fungal and oomycete pathogens from conifer (Pinaceae) needles and potato (Solanum tuberosum) leaves and tubers. We demonstrate that the Sequel instrument is efficient for metabarcoding of complex samples, whereas MinION is not suited for this purpose due to a high error rate and multiple biases. However, we find that MinION can be utilized for rapid and accurate identification of dominant pathogenic organisms and other associated organisms from plant tissues following both amplicon-based and PCR-free metagenomics approaches. Using the metagenomics approach with shortened DNA extraction and incubation times, we performed the entire MinION workflow, from sample preparation through DNA extraction, sequencing, bioinformatics, and interpretation, in 2.5 h. We advocate the use of MinION for rapid diagnostics of pathogens and potentially other organisms, but care needs to be taken to control or account for multiple potential technical biases. IMPORTANCE Microbial pathogens cause enormous losses to agriculture and forestry, but current combined culturing- and molecular identification-based detection methods are too slow for rapid identification and application of countermeasures.

There are achieved by analyzing the requirements for the electric drive by the operating body. The scientific work has a relationship between the parameters of the quality of rolling the blanks for agricultural facilities and the precision parameters of the electric drive in terms of overshoot parameters and absolute positioning accuracy. It is shown that this dependence is non-linear in the position electric drive and depends more on the size of the overshoot and a significantly smaller ratio from absolute accuracy. The permissible overshoot value depends on the absolute accuracy and has range from 5 to 10%. The largest value of the overshoot is achieved with absolute positioning accuracy with an error not exceeding 2%. The obtained values of the control parameters can be successfully applied in the design of the position agricultural electric drive. So, if you provide sufficient positioning accuracy with an error not exceeding 2%, which is achieved by the use of position sensors with a resolution of at least 10 000 pulses per revolution, the modeling electric drive in the position loop can be adjusted with an allowable overshoot of 10%, and therefore, increased system performance while maintaining quality control indicators.",2019,0,0,10.1088/1755-1315/315/3/032043,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/835b28541b22283a8c53c0232fae1865a045645c,Conference,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environment

Undocumented evidence points to misconceptions, misuse or underuse of statistics among agricultural researchers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA); pointing to the possibility that the subject has been part of the causes the unfulfilled targets in the agricultural sector in the region. The objective of this study was to analyse and document weaknesses in statistical practice in agricultural research, with a view to identifying entry points for strengthening the performance of the sector for SSA to be able to achieve its set goals. A desk study involving 165 research articles published in the African Crop Science Journal over the period of 17 years (2000 to 2017) was conducted through a rigorous SWOT analysis for issues related to the use of statistics in the implementation of agricultural research in SSA. A checklist consisting of key elements related to study design; data collection, analysis and exploitation; and presentation, was used to guide the interrogation. Findings indicated that researchers generally made explicit description of treatment structures that fairly matched the study objectives and hypotheses (in the few cases where they were stated), with a few weaknesses in the description of factorial treatment structure. The Randomised Complete Block Design was most commonly used among the designs, with 3-4 replicates. However, there was hardly any justification for its use, as the blocking factors were never mentioned and thus their role in determining the precision of the results was difficult to determine. Analysis of Variance was the main method for data analysis, followed by correlations. The F-test and the associated P-values were the basis for decisions on treatment differences. Most researchers had problems with presentation and interpretation of P-values and significance level. Post adhoc tests mostly used the Least Significant Difference (LSD) for pairwise mean comparisons, with little consideration for the treatment structure, the number of treatments and the nature (qualitative or quantitative). Generally, estimates of treatment means were presented together with various measures of precision, in both tables and graphical forms. In several cases, LSD was used or misused interchangeably with standard error (SE) or standard error of difference (SED). Several statistical software were used for data analysis and presentation, with the main ones being SAS, Genstat and MSTAT-C. Key entry points for improvement heavily lie in human and infrastructural resource capacity improvement, most specifically in (i) periodic review of university and other tertiary institutions’ curricula to provide sufficient time allocation, physical space and relevant infrastructure for true hands on practice; (ii) more effective utilisation of the few statisticians available in the region, (iii) short term staff in-service retooling courses, (iv) sustained statistical service units wherever necessary, and (v) provision for periodic interactive statistician-researcher platforms (such as conferences and workshops) for sharing notes on challenges and achievements during implementation of their research programmes.

Low Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) is an emerging IoT networking paradigm to meet three key requirements of IoT applications, i.e., low cost, large scale deployment and high energy efficiency. Among all available LPWAN technologies, LoRa networking has attracted much attention from both academia and industry, since it specifies an open standard and allows us to build autonomous LPWAN networks without any third-party infrastructure. Many LoRa networks have been developed recently, e.g., managing solar plants in Carson City, Nevada, USA and power monitoring in Lyon and Grenoble, France. However, there are still many research challenges to develop practical LoRa networks, e.g., link coordination, resource allocation, reliable transmissions and security. This article provides a comprehensive survey on LoRa networks, including the technical challenges of deploying LoRa networks and recent solutions. Based on our detailed analysis of current solutions, some open issues of LoRa networking are discussed.

RGB monocular image has only naive information about depth and although LiDAR has accurate depth information, it can only provide sparse depth maps. By interpolating sparse LiDAR with aligned color image, reliable dense depth maps can be created. In this paper, we apply a deep regression model where an RGB monocular image was used for a sparse-to-dense LiDAR depth map completion. Our model is based on U-Net architecture presented in [9]. Training the model on the Fieldsafe dataset which is a multi-modal agricultural dataset, however, leads to overfitting. Therefore, we trained the model on the Kitti dataset with high image diversity and test it on the Fieldsafe. We produced an error map to analyze performance of the model for close or far distant objects in the Fieldsafe dataset. The error maps show the absolute difference between the depth ground truth and the predicted depth value. The model preforms 63.6% better on close distance objects than far objects in Fieldsafe.

cddb973142d093d247ba0628de216009f4f7bf65,Mapping Plastic Mulched Farmland for High Resolution Images of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Using Deep Semantic Segmentation,"With increasing consumption, plastic mulch benefits agriculture by promoting crop quality and yield, but the environmental and soil pollution is becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, research on the monitoring of plastic mulched farmland (PMF) has received increasing attention. Plastic mulched farmland in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote images due to the high resolution, shows a prominent spatial pattern, which brings difficulties to the task of monitoring PMF. In this paper, through a comparison between two deep semantic segmentation methods, SegNet and fully convolutional networks (FCN), and a traditional classification method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), we propose an end-to-end deep-learning method aimed at accurately recognizing PMF for UAV remote sensing images from Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia, China. After experiments with single-band, three-band and six-band image data, we found that deep semantic segmentation models built via single-band data which only use the texture pattern of PMF can identify it well; for example, SegNet reaching the highest accuracy of 88.68% in a 900 nm band. Furthermore, with three visual bands and six-band data (3 visible bands and 3 near-infrared bands), deep semantic segmentation models combining the texture and spectral features further improve the accuracy of PMF identification, whereas six-band data obtains an optimal performance for FCN and SegNet. In addition, deep semantic segmentation methods, FCN and SegNet, due to their strong feature extraction capability and direct pixel classification, clearly outperform the traditional SVM method in precision and speed. Among three classification methods, SegNet model built on three-band and six-band data obtains the optimal average accuracy of 89.62% and 90.6%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed deep semantic segmentation model, when tested against the traditional classification method, provides a promising path for mapping PMF in UAV remote sensing images.",2019,39,1,10.3390/rs11172008,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cddb973142d093d247ba0628de216009f4f7bf65,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing
7ff0b02fbe93d28085122576140e9247aeec4271,Estimation of Corn Canopy Chlorophyll Content Using Derivative Spectra in the O2–A Absorption Band,"Chlorophyll (Chl) is one of the most important classes of light-absorbing pigments in photosynthesis, and the proportion of Chl in leaves is closely related to vegetation nutrient status. Remote sensing-based estimation of Chl content holds great potential for evaluating crop growth status in agricultural management, precision farming and ecosystem monitoring. Recent studies have shown that steady-state fluorescence contributed up to 2% on the apparent reflectance in the 750-nm spectral region of plant and also provided additional evidence for fluorescence in-filling of the atmospheric oxygen absorption band at a central wavelength of 760 nm (O2–A band). In this study, an in situ hyperspectral remote sensing approach zwas employed to estimate corn Chl content at the canopy level by using chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) signals in the O2–A absorption band. Two new spectral indices, REArea760 (sum of first derivative reflectance between 755 and 763 nm) and REA760 (maximum of first derivative reflectance between 755 and 763 nm), derived from the first derivative spectra in the O2–A band, were proposed for estimating the corn canopy Chl content (CCC). They were compared with the performance of published indices measured at ground level, including the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI), Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index 2 (OSAVI2), Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index 2 (MCARI2), SR710, REArea (sum of first derivative reflectance between 680 and 780 nm), REA (maximum value of first derivative reflectance between 680 and 780 nm), and mND705. The results indicated that corn Chl content at the canopy level was better predicted by the new indices (with R2 = 0.835) than the published indices (with R2 ranging from 0.676 to 0.826). The two new indices ranked in the top four according to their summed ranks by integrating the ranks of RMSE and R2 of CCC linear regression models. ChlF originates only from chlorophyll in the photosynthetic apparatus and therefore is less sensitive to soil, wood, and dead biomass interference. Moreover, due to the fluorescence in-filling of the O2–A band and the amplified effect on spectrum signals by derivative operation, the spectral derivative indices in the O2–A band have great potential for estimating the CCC.",2019,17,0,10.3389/fpls.2019.01047,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ff0b02fbe93d28085122576140e9247aeec4271,JournalArticle,Frontiers in Plant Science

Through the use of cryopreserved semen and artificial insemination, sperm from the best breeding bulls can be used to inseminate thousands of cows around the world. Although cryopreservation of bull sperm has advanced beyond that of other species, there are still major gaps in the knowledge and technology bases. Post-thaw viability of sperm is still low and differs significantly among the breeding bulls. These weaknesses are important because they are preventing advances both in fundamental science of mammalian gametes and reproductive biotechnology. Various extenders have been developed and supplemented with chemicals to reduce cryodamage or oxidative stress with varying levels of success. More detailed insights on sperm morphology and function have been uncovered through application of advanced tools in modern molecular and cell biology. This article provides a concise review of progress in the cryopreservation of bull sperm, advances in extender development, and frontiers using diverse techniques of the study of sperm viability.

The socio-economic status of the countries is ever-changing due to the increasing population. 'Green Revolution', a paradigm shift towards technology driven agriculture, has ensured a good quality of life to some extent for this increasing population. However, it brings in several negative impacts on the environment, which poses a threat to the sustainability of agriculture and natural resources. Precision agriculture (PA) is a state-of-the-art concept of site-specific farm management that helps to overcome this threat in a smart way using modern information and communication technologies. It reduces the indecorous use of resources, pollution and hence improves quality of life, which in turn helps to achieve sustainable development goals.

A procedure that's rising as a valuable device in picture handling. This report pQresents a brief overview of the utilize of picture handling strategies to guidance experts and agriculturists improve rural practices. Picture handling was utilized to guidance with precision developing practices, herbicide, and herbicide propels, plant development checking and plant sustenance the executives. The identification of green from the control images of the development of the harvest is the first imperative advance for the examination of the state of development of the harvest. In precision agribusiness, extricate the greenness parts in plants could be an exceptionally important assignment. Perhaps the most serious issue, with regards to artificial vision, is the division of the pictures that persuaded the assessments on the practices in this work. Our objective is the division of the greenness of the plants and parts of the soil of the image. The observation of crop development was one of the agricultural centers. Techniques for green recognizable proof are based on a color index-based methods, for example, an excess of the green index, an excess of green index minus an excess of the red index, a color index of vegetation extraction, a vegetative index, a combined index. These strategies work to show a clear greenness in the plant when the picture is captured from outside classify plant weeds. Four distinct test instances are conducted to assess the scheme in which the percentage of weeds in all test instances is much greater. The system can identify plant and weed regions with a success rate of 96.37% and weed detection accuracy is 88.99%. The system uses the support vector machine in decision-making management to assess and isolate crop weeds. The findings are used sometimes later to handle which crops are receiving herbicides and which are not. In the superimposed pictures, in which weeds need to be separated from crops, the most necessary for the image segmentation method. It involves two basic modules: (1) decision-making based on image histogram assessment and (2) greenery identification in which two unique methodologies, one based on classic vegetable recognition methods and the other inspired by the Fuzzy Clustering strategy. The system is tested with some camera systems for unique pictures captured. A fresh automatic ES in the areas of corn and barley to identify ecological pictures in agricultural pictures. The ES is based on two main modules, in which the first one roughly chooses the image quality through histogram analysis. The methodology was tested for particular position treatments with a broad range of pictures from various photographic instruments, all situated in automatic applications in agrarian pictures and captured under extremely distinct natural circumstances.

3512268ca9337da51a24ac809acc9c866875a6ef,Variable-power ADS-B for UAS,"Small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) have the potential for a large array of highly-beneficial applications. These applications include search and rescue, fire spotting, precision agriculture, etc. just to name a few. Typically sUAS vehicles weigh less than 55 lbs and will be performing flight operations in the National Air Space (NAS). Certain sUAS applications, such as package delivery, will include operations in the close proximity of the general public. Operations of sUAS vehicles pose risks to people and property on the ground as well as to manned aviation. The full benefit from sUAS is contingent upon the resolution of several technological areas in order to provide an acceptable level of risk for widespread sUAS operations. One significant technological area currently precluding widespread sUAS operations in the NAS is the ability to prevent sUAS from colliding with other sUAS and/or manned aircraft. Autonomous sense and avoid (ASAA) can provide sUAS the capability to maneuver around other vehicles, but is contingent upon adequate knowledge of traffic aircraft position. Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), already employed for manned aircraft, can be an excellent method of providing adequate air traffic position information. However, the large number of anticipated sUAS would be expected to completely saturate the ADS-B system, degrading existing ADS-B applications. One promising method of cooperative traffic position communication for sUAS is through reduced-power ADS-B. Reduced power output would greatly reduce the effect each vehicle has on the overall ADS-B system. The over-arching objective of the current effort was to determine if a transmit power level could be defined that would enable effective ASAA for sUAS while still providing useful alerts to manned aircraft without risking oversaturation of the ADS-B spectrum. Flight testing was performed for several ADS-B power levels. ADS-B communication from sUAS to sUAS and sUAS to manned aircraft were evaluated to ascertain the efficacy of this approach.",2019,7,0,10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081640,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3512268ca9337da51a24ac809acc9c866875a6ef,Conference,Symposium on Dependable Autonomic and Secure Computing

Adequate spatiotemporal characterization of these attributes is fundamental to the successful development of strategies for variable rate application of fertilizers, enabling the classic benefits of precision agriculture (PA). Studies on Brazilian soil have shown that at least 1 sample ha is required for the reliable mapping of key fertility attributes. However, this sampling density is difficult owing to the operational challenges of sample collection and the cost of laboratory analyses. Given this limitation, soil sensors have emerged as a practical and complementary technique for obtaining information on soil attributes, at high spatial density, without the production of chemical residues and at a reduced cost. Scientists worldwide have devoted their attention to the development and application of sensor systems for this purpose. The concept of proximal soil sensing (PSS) was established in 2011 and involves the application of soil sensors directly on the field. PSS techniques involve different disciplines, such as instrumentation, data science, geostatistics, and predictive modeling. The integration of these different disciplines has allowed successful sensor application for the spatial diagnosis of soil fertility attributes.

7fe8d127b7ac7a639d1b9b2f4369843bcef4f064,Navigation Algorithm Based on the Boundary Line of Tillage Soil Combined with Guided Filtering and Improved Anti-Noise Morphology,"An improved anti-noise morphology vision navigation algorithm is proposed for intelligent tractor tillage in a complex agricultural field environment. At first, the two key steps of guided filtering and improved anti-noise morphology navigation line extraction were addressed in detail. Then, the experiments were carried out in order to verify the effectiveness and advancement of the presented algorithm. Finally, the optimal template and its application condition were studied for improving the image-processing speed. The comparison experiment results show that the YCbCr color space has minimum time consumption of 0.094 s in comparison with HSV, HIS, and 2R-G-B color spaces. The guided filtering method can effectively distinguish the boundary between the tillage soil compared to other competing vanilla methods such as Tarel, multi-scale retinex, wavelet-based retinex, and homomorphic filtering in spite of having the fastest processing speed of 0.113 s. The extracted soil boundary line of the improved anti-noise morphology algorithm has the best precision and speed compared to other operators such as Sobel, Roberts, Prewitt, and Log. After comparing different sizes of image templates, the optimal template with the size of 140 × 260 pixels could achieve high-precision vision navigation while the course deviation angle was not more than 7.5°. The maximum tractor speed of the optimal template and global template were 51.41 km/h and 27.47 km/h, respectively, which can meet the real-time vision navigation requirement of the smart tractor tillage operation in the field. The experimental vision navigation results demonstrated the feasibility of the autonomous vision navigation for tractor tillage operation in the field using the tillage soil boundary line extracted by the proposed improved anti-noise morphology algorithm, which has broad application prospect.",2019,9,0,10.3390/s19183918,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7fe8d127b7ac7a639d1b9b2f4369843bcef4f064,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors
82476f4cd74de4e837f58172ec9308307e71a96c,A Pattern Analysis-based Segmentation to Localize Early and Late Blight Disease Lesions in Digital Images of Plant Leaves,"This study reports a disease symptom classification algorithm using a proposed pattern recognition approach to individually localize early and late blight visual disease symptoms. The algorithm uses the pathological analogy hierarchy of the diseases to produce a novel homogeneous pattern localization, more informative to extract features that would be utilized for a machine learning system to classify the two diseases in digital photographs of vegetable plants. One of the most significant advantages of the proposed pattern analysis is localizing symptomatic and necrotic regions based on pathological disease analogy using soft computing, with which the pattern of each disease manifestation along the leaf surface can be tracked and quantified for characterization. In the 1st phase of the experiment, individual symptomatic (Rs), necrotic ($\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{N}}$), and blurred ($\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{B}}$, in-between healthy and symptomatic) regions were identified, segmented, and quantified. The 2nd phase focuses on the extraction of pattern features for classification and severity estimation with a machine learning classifier. The obtained results are encouraging, successfully localizing and quantifying individual disease lesions. This also indicates the enhanced applicability of the proposed approach discriminating the two diseases based on their dissimilarity. It is also envisaged that the algorithm can be extended to other plant disease symptoms. Moreover, it provides opportunities for early identification and detection of subtle changes in plant growth, disease stage, and severity estimation to assisting crop diagnostics in precision agriculture.",2019,6,0,10.1109/ICSIPA45851.2019.8977798,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82476f4cd74de4e837f58172ec9308307e71a96c,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications

Navigation system based on Global Positioning System has been well developed, however Global Positioning System cannot provide enough information on crop row and sometimes suffers from disturbance from the environment. So it is necessary to develop local sensor that can detect crop row during harvesting tasks. This article aims to integrate a self-developed mechanical detection sensor into a row guidance control system. The mechanical row detection device based on angular sensor was used to detect crop row and return detected values as deviation for row guidance controller. The control method was introduced after linearizing the kinematic model of farm vehicle, then the road test platform was introduced. The test was conducted under three different speeds. We used Global Positioning System and inertial measuring unit to record the position and heading of the vehicle. For the road test, the average cross track error are below 0.1m, which meet the demand of navigation of combine corn harvester.",2019,4,0,10.1109/ICISCAE48440.2019.221651,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/84fe90db0bd5daf0a44b22a1e35471130c43f093,Conference,International Conference on Information Systems and Computer Aided Education
89a0e2cd10cb7a670fd609d42c3bbf416522c307,A Look at the September Issue [From the Editor],"elcome to the September 2019 issue of IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine. I am writing this during the long flight home from Japan after attending the IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) in Yokohama this year. It was a very exciting, informative, and educational week, providing the opportunity to interact with colleagues from around the world, see the latest developments in remote sensing, and present some of my own work. (You can read more about IGARSS 2019 in this issue’s “Conference Reports” column.) The good news is that the magazine continues to grow, as indicated by both our increasing impact factor (9.659) and the number of features (four) in this issue. As editor-in-chief, my goal is to maintain this growth by actively seeking quality articles on the remote sensing topics that have the most interest to you, our readers. With the growing use of remote sensing data to make important decisions, especially on questions affecting health and safety, it is important to be aware of the data quality and possible biases. This is the focus of the September issue’s first feature. Fine-particulate matter in the atmosphere can be quantified by the variable PM2.5, representing the concentration of particles with diameters smaller than . . 2 5 m n Particles this small can penetrate deep into human lungs, and this leads to millions of premature deaths globally each year. For this reason, PM2.5 is used to issue health advisories related to air pollution. Authors Lijian Han et al. evaluated a common PM2.5 product [generated from moderateresolution imaging spectroradiometer (i.e., MODIS), multiangle imaging spectroradiometer, and sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor data], against “truth” measurements at ground-station networks in China, where air pollution remains a significant concern. While satellite remote sensing can provide global repetitive coverage, some applications require a higher spatial or temporal resolution or a more responsive ability to collect measurements on short time scales. For these applications, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be a better solution. The use of miniature UAVs (mini-UAVs), with mass below 30 kg, in remote sensing is increasing in popularity due to the lower costs and simplicity of operation. The timeliness of data and higher spatial resolution at a lower altitude have enabled new applications in fields such as precision agriculture and emergency response. Generating useful remote sensing data from miniUAVs, however, presents several challenges due to the geometric and color calibration of typical consumer-grade cameras employed and the low altitude. With these concerns in mind, our second feature, by Tian-Zhu Xiang, Gui-Song Xia, and Liangpei Zhang, provides a broad survey of the current state of the art in data processing for mini-UAVs, concluding with a discussion of some novel applications and an assessment of current research needs. The article also includes a directory of open source code implementing some of the mentioned algorithms. A few open source data sets, both synthesized and real, are also identified for use in training deep-learning methods or fine-tuning models. Urban impervious surfaces (UlS) are human-built structures such as roofs or streets that prevent subsurface runoff. UIS affect hydrological circulation and increase the amount of runoff carrying pesticides, sediment, or other pollutants directly into rivers and lakes. UIS land cover can increase heat islands and reduce vegetation cover. Finally, the extent of UIS can also be an indicator of socioeconomic development. Given this importance, our third feature presents a timely review of remote sensing methods for estimating UIS. After introducing some key challenges, authors Yuliang Wang and Mingshi Li present a thorough review of various algorithms designed for use with hyperspectral data, passive optical A Look at the September Issue",2019,0,0,10.1109/mgrs.2019.2928932,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/89a0e2cd10cb7a670fd609d42c3bbf416522c307,Review,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine
953391d95baf557b6dc78caeed20e7ac666e789a,"Optimally Scheduling Complex Logistics Operations Involving Acquisition, Elaboration and Action Tasks","Optimization algorithms can dramatically improve the efficiency of logistics operations. However, when complex tasks are involved, there is a significant lack of good models and optimized solutions. For instance, when it is necessary to perform more than one operation at each specific point in space, potentially depending on the outcome of others, finding optimal solutions for the operator movements may become extremely difficult. This work addresses such context, in which one operator is required to perform acquisition, elaboration and action tasks while visiting a set of positions, with complex sequential dependencies. An example could be an automatic operator, i.e., an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), that is required to help in precision agriculture activities. For clarity's sake, we will mostly focus on the precision agriculture scenario, but our model and results can be readily applied to the other contexts described in more details in the paper, e.g., scheduling of robot operations or repair companies. After formulating the general problem analytically as an integer linear programming problem, we propose an algorithm that is guaranteed to find the global minimum cost solution in terms of time needed to complete the operations. Tests on instances of the optimization problems with a different number of nodes show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in terms of computational time.",2019,2,0,10.1109/RTSI.2019.8895543,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/953391d95baf557b6dc78caeed20e7ac666e789a,JournalArticle,International Forum on Research and Technologies for Society and Industry Leveraging a better tomorrow

The paper presents a hierarchical structure based on the collaboration between a team of unmanned aerial vehicles and a structure of federated wireless sensor networks for crop monitoring in precision agriculture. Key advantages lay in online data collection and relaying to a central monitoring point while effectively managing network load and latency through optimised UAV trajectories and in situ data processing. The experiments were carried out at the Fundulea National Research Institute where different crops and methods are developed. The results demonstrate the fact that the collaborative UAV-WSN approach implemented in the Romanian project MUWI increases the performances both in precision agriculture and ecological agriculture.",2019,17,0,10.1109/IDAACS.2019.8924424,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a156ea4fb64737236a01fc949a615067ed3c3fc7,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications
a929fae0aa33e5d311810db96c37bb7b3f988089,Integrating Geophysical and Multispectral Data to Delineate Homogeneous Management Zones within a Vineyard in Northern Italy,"Soil electrical conductivity (EC) maps obtained through proximal soil sensing (i.e., geophysical data) are usually considered to delineate homogeneous site-specific management zones (SSMZ), used in Precision Agriculture to improve crop production. The recent literature recommends the integration of geophysical soil monitoring data with crop information acquired through multispectral (VIS-NIR) imagery. In non-flat areas, where topography can influence the soil water conditions and consequently the crop water status and the crop yield, considering topography data together with soil and crop data may improve the SSMZ delineation. The objective of this study was the fusion of EC and VIS-NIR data to delineate SSMZs in a rain-fed vineyard located in Northern Italy (Franciacorta), and the assessment of the obtained SSMZ map through the comparison with data acquired by a thermal infrared (TIR) survey carried out during a hot and dry period of the 2017 agricultural season. Data integration is performed by applying multivariate statistical methods (i.e., Principal Component Analysis). The results show that the combined use of soil, topography and crop information improves the SSMZ delineation. Indeed, the correspondence between the SSMZ map and the CWSI map derived from TIR imagery was enhanced by including the NDVI information.",2019,12,1,10.3390/s19183974,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a929fae0aa33e5d311810db96c37bb7b3f988089,"JournalArticle,Review",Italian National Conference on Sensors
ab58f2695fb05acaa33119533c7173742b508fa9,Precision Agriculture Techniques and Practices: From Considerations to Applications,"Internet of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced production with reduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the main drivers of automation in the agriculture domain. PA uses specific sensors and software to ensure that the crops receive exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the sensors deployed in the fields. High-resolution images of crops are obtained from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned or unmanned), which are further processed to extract information used to provide future decisions. In this paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain is presented along with several considerations and challenges. This survey includes wireless communication technologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms used to obtain spectral images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral images and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a case study showing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an IoT-based smart solution for crop health monitoring, which is comprised of two modules. The first module is a wireless sensor network-based system to monitor real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude remote sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed to classify healthy and unhealthy crops.

af15288eccd9e4f93e8a6afdafab2cba8b12f7ac,"sUAS Swarm Navigation using Inertial, Range Radios and Partial GNSS","Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) operations are increasing in demand and complexity. Using multiple cooperative sUAS (i.e. a swarm) can be beneficial and is sometimes necessary to perform certain tasks (e.g., precision agriculture, mapping, surveillance) either independent or collaboratively. However, controlling the flight of multiple sUAS autonomously and in real-time in a challenging environment in terms of obstacles and navigation requires highly accurate absolute and relative position and velocity information for all platforms in the swarm. This information is also necessary to effectively and efficiently resolve possible collision encounters between the sUAS. In our swarm, each platform is equipped with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensor, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a baro-altimeter and a relative range sensor (range radio). When GNSS is available, its measurements are tightly integrated with IMU, baro-altimeter and range-radio measurements to obtain the platform's absolute and relative position. When GNSS is not available due to external factors (e.g., obstructions, interference), the position and velocity estimators switch to an integrated solution based on IMU, baro and relative range measurements. This solution enables the system to maintain an accurate relative position estimate, and reduce the drift in the swarm's absolute position estimate as is typical of an IMU-based system. Multiple multi-copter data collection platforms have been developed and equipped with GNSS, inertial sensors and range radios, which were developed at Ohio University. This paper outlines the underlying methodology, the platform hardware components (three multi-copters and one ground station) and analyzes and discusses the performance using both simulation and sUAS flight test data.",2019,10,0,10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081793,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af15288eccd9e4f93e8a6afdafab2cba8b12f7ac,Conference,Symposium on Dependable Autonomic and Secure Computing

dffc14dc8c88ccbc229e92a1a9dd5e8a08a80fd6,SEEN: A Selective Encryption Method to Ensure Confidentiality for Big Sensing Data Streams,"Resource constrained sensing devices are being used widely to build and deploy self-organizing wireless sensor networks for a variety of critical applications such as smart cities, smart health, precision agriculture and industrial control systems. Many such devices sense the deployed environment and generate a variety of data and send them to the server for analysis as data streams. A Data Stream Manager (DSM) at the server collects the data streams (often called big data) to perform real time analysis and decision-making for these critical applications. A malicious adversary may access or tamper with the data in transit. One of the challenging tasks in such applications is to assure the trustworthiness of the collected data so that any decisions are made on the processing of correct data. Assuring high data trustworthiness requires that the system satisfies two key security properties: confidentiality and integrity. To ensure the confidentiality of collected data, we need to prevent sensitive information from reaching the wrong people by ensuring that the right people are getting it. Sensed data are always associated with different sensitivity levels based on the sensitivity of emerging applications or the sensed data types or the sensing devices. For example, a temperature in a precision agriculture application may not be as sensitive as monitored data in smart health. Providing multilevel data confidentiality along with data integrity for big sensing data streams in the context of near real time analytics is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a Selective Encryption (SEEN) method to secure big sensing data streams that satisfies the desired multiple levels of confidentiality and data integrity. Our method is based on two key concepts: common shared keys that are initialized and updated by DSM without requiring retransmission, and a seamless key refreshment process without interrupting the data stream encryption/decryption. Theoretical analyses and experimental results of our SEEN method show that it can significantly improve the efficiency and buffer usage at DSM without compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the data streams.",2019,56,2,10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2702172,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dffc14dc8c88ccbc229e92a1a9dd5e8a08a80fd6,JournalArticle,IEEE Transactions on Big Data

a7d373209d694ef30efc094e404343a96695754f,Genomic clues of the evolutionary history of Bos indicus cattle.,"Together with their sister subspecies Bos taurus, zebu cattle (Bos indicus) have contributed to important socioeconomic changes that have shaped modern civilizations. Zebu cattle were domesticated in the Indus Valley 8000 years before present (YBP). From the domestication site, they expanded to Africa, East Asia, southwestern Asia and Europe between 4000 and 1300 YBP, intercrossing with B. taurus to form clinal variations of zebu ancestry across the landmass of Afro-Eurasia. In the past 150 years, zebu cattle reached the Americas and Oceania, where they have contributed to the prosperity of emerging economies. The zebu genome is characterized by two mitochondrial haplogroups (I1 and I2), one Y chromosome haplogroup (Y3) and three major autosomal ancestral groups (Indian-Pakistani, African and Chinese). Phenotypically, zebu animals are recognized by their hump, large ears and excess skin. They are rustic, resilient to parasites and capable of bearing the hot and humid climates of the tropics. Many resources are available to study the zebu genome, including commercial arrays of SNP, reference assemblies and publicly available genotypes and whole-genome sequences. Nevertheless, many of these resources were initially developed to support research and subsidize industrial applications in B. taurus, and therefore they can produce bias in data analysis. The combination of genomics with precision agriculture holds great promise for the identification of genetic variants affecting economically important traits such as tick resistance and heat tolerance, which were naturally selected for millennia and played a major role in the evolution of B. indicus cattle.",2019,81,4,10.1111/age.12836,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a7d373209d694ef30efc094e404343a96695754f,"Review,JournalArticle",Animal Genetics

1cfce8ea7e87d9de861a7e79ff6656c6cf2a2d2c,Commercialization of Irish moss aquaculture: the Canadian experience,"Abstract Irish moss traditionally has been valued for its hydrocolloid composition. Recognition that natural harvests would not meet the expected demands for its biomass led to experimental pilot-scale cultivation based on principles used in agriculture. Innovative technologies and systems for aquaculture management were devised when those from agriculture or mariculture were not directly transferrable. Periods of rapid progress and of consolidation due to disruptive external events were encountered, a cycle not uncommon during the introduction of a new technology. Certain key decisions in the background matrix that ultimately led to Irish moss cultivation are reviewed together with an overview of the main critical events that affected progress. The Chondrus crispus aquaculture as practiced today is essentially a modified form of precision agriculture operating year-round with c. 3.4 ha of on-land culture tanks and up to 75 employees during the peak season. Beginning with new Irish moss seedstock from the library/nursery, the crop is generated through a closely controlled, vertically integrated system of cultivation that after approximately 18 months increases the biomass more than 50,000-fold. After harvesting it is processed into the final food-grade products to meet the stringent demands of the export market.",2019,18,1,10.1515/bot-2019-0017,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1cfce8ea7e87d9de861a7e79ff6656c6cf2a2d2c,Review,Botanica Marina
fbc943628933c9135d0b9807275dca516f7beab2,Generation of a High-Precision Digital Elevation Model for Fields in Mountain Regions Using RTK-GPS,"In modern agriculture, many advanced automated devices are used on farms. To improve the working efficiency of agricultural vehicles, fields are expected to be pre-leveled, because the vehicles work more effectively on a flat field. Leveling a field requires the current field elevation map. Some farmers in Japan have begun to use high-precision real-time kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS)-based self-steering tractors in the fields. This study uses the RTK-GPS information from a self-steering tractor system to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) especially in mountain regions where the fields are not flat. In addition, all of the information is from the self-steering system with the result that farmers can use the method of this study without additional instruments. However, the GPS receiver sometimes cannot obtain high-quality signals from satellites in mountain regions. Therefore, this study focuses on how to create a high-precision DEM even when a GPS signal is unavailable. It proposes a dynamic interpolation method for generating a DEM. In addition, a test was conducted in a field in a mountain region. The test results show that the dynamic interpolation method can provide an accuracy of less than 0.03 m in the test field for creating a DEM.",2019,9,0,10.20965/ijat.2019.p0671,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fbc943628933c9135d0b9807275dca516f7beab2,JournalArticle,International Journal of Automation Technology

Many sensors were developed and implemented into the agricultural production. GPS is one of the most used sensor even the cost of high accuracy GPS or RTK-GPS is still high. Fortunately, the cost of single unit GPS is significantly decreased. Main objective of this research is to evaluate the precision of the low-cost GPS in the performance perspective in smart farm tractor applications. A low-cost GPS-position tracking and data logger was developed. The evaluation was done by leaving the developed data logger unit stationary in three different circumstance condition; Open field; Under tree canopy and Near building. The result show that the position recorded had standard deviation of precision of 0.57, 0.85 and 2.22 m in longitude-axis and 0.29, 0.64 and 0.91 m in latitude-axis for Open field; Under tree canopy and Near building respectively. The next state of the research is to evaluate the accuracy of the developed GPS-data logger in dynamics operation together with the performance comparison with the commercial GPS data logger. The result shows that the precision level of 0.5 m is still needed to be developed. Otherwise, the integrated sensor technique must be implied.",2019,1,0,10.1088/1755-1315/301/1/012019,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4d4d42653431766f4776bd5b69f7b88533d89468,Conference,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environment

These CECs are from a wide range of major classes including pharmaceuticals, household, industrial and agricultural. This method utilises ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) for analysis of five matrices (three liquid and two solid) from wastewater treatment processes and the surrounding environment. Relative recoveries were predominantly between 80 and 120%; however, due to the complexity of the matrices used in this work, not all compounds were recovered in all matrices, from 138/142 analytes in surface water to 96/142 analytes in digested solids. Method quantification limits (MQLs) ranged from 0.004 ng L−1 (bisoprolol in surface water) to 3118 ng L−1 (creatinine in wastewater treatment work (WwTW) influent). The overall method accuracy was 107.0%, and precision was 13.4%. To test its performance, the method was applied to the range of environmental matrices at WwTWs in South West England. Overall, this method was found to be suitable for application in catchment-based exposure-driven studies, as, of the total number of analytes quantifiable in each matrix, 61% on average was found to be above their corresponding MQL. The results confirm the need for analysing both the liquid and solid compartments within a WwTW to prevent under-reporting of concentrations.",2019,28,0,10.1007/s00216-019-02091-8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22f8d3ce4d58529826e6c0faeca3f50755dc611e,JournalArticle,Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry

Agriculture 4.0 is characterized by precision agriculture, artificial intelligence, plant factories, and digital marketing. In Indonesia since 2015, online Aggregators have begun to appear in agriculture, which are intermediary actors using internet-based applications or websites that act as liaison for farmers with markets, suppliers and funders. This online aggregator also acts as a mobilizer for partner farmers towards agriculture 4.0. But problems appear when farmers are not ready to face increasingly rapid technological advances. The purpose of this study was to explore the farmer's position towards agriculture 4.0, especially partner of aggregator online vegetable commodities. This study used survey methods to collect information from farmers used questionnaire. Sampling method used the quota sampling to select 36 farmers from 12 aggregators online vegetables commodity. Analysis of the position of farmers using the questionnaire based on indicators on the 6 elements of management are man, material, method, machine, money, market in agricultural positions 1.0 to position 4.0. The results of the questionnaire are then processed based on the arithmetic mean. The results showed the position of aggregate partner farmers in general were able to pass the phase of the agricultural revolution 3.0 towards agriculture 4.0.

9aeceed46c85cf2b28a0e2273186f0718686b155,"Local Area Variation in Morbidity Among Low-Income, Older Adults in the United States","Supplement. Supplemental Material Geographic variation in mortality and morbidity and the association between socioeconomic status and health are both widely recognized (111). Researchers have found that there are substantial differences in life expectancy and in causes of death across U.S. geographic regions, even after accounting for differences in age, sex, and racial composition (1224). A separate, large literature has reported differences in mortality and morbidity between different socioeconomic and demographic groups in the United States (13, 16, 22, 2538). More recently, substantial differences in the income-longevity association were found across geographic locations (39, 40). Researchers have documented that adults with incomes in the first quartile of the income distribution living in more affluent areas of the United States have higher life expectancies (39). To our knowledge, limited evidence exists on the local area variation in morbidity stratified by income using clinical measures of diagnoses and large samples of the U.S. population. Using 100% of Medicare administrative records, we aimed to assess the association between the prevalence of chronic conditions among low-income, older adults and the economic affluence of local areas in the United States. We used receipt of the low-income subsidy in the Medicare Part D pharmaceutical benefit as a measure of low income. We hypothesized that low-income, older adults living in more affluent areas of the country are healthier and that areas with poor health in the low-income, older adult population tend to have a high prevalence of most chronic conditions. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional association analysis using 100% of administrative Medicare records for 2015. The Institutional Review Board of the National Bureau of Economic Research approved this study. A total of 6.4 million older adults with a history of low-income support under the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit for at least 1 month between 2006 and 2015 were included in the study. The Medicare Part D program, which enrolls more than 70% of all Medicare beneficiaries in the United States, provides cost sharing and premium subsidies for beneficiaries who have incomes less than 150% of the federal poverty line and modest countable assets (41, 42). More than 85% of low-income subsidy recipients are automatically enrolled into the program by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) (43). Data Sources Medicare administrative data for 2006 to 2015 were obtained from CMS. For the 58.3 million persons enrolled in Medicare in 2015, the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF) provided information about age, sex, race, Social Security Administration (SSA) county code, Medicare Part D enrollment status, receipt of low-income support under Part D, and time of first diagnosis for 57 chronic conditions tracked by CMS. From the 2006 to 2014 MBSF, for each person in the data, we obtained the history of whether they received Part D low-income subsidies. The CMS and the Health Inequality Project (https://healthinequality.org/) provided the mapping of SSA county codes to Federal Information Processing Standards codes and in turn to commuting zone (CZ) codes, as well as information on median house prices in each CZ and whether each CZ intersected a metropolitan statistical area. Sample Persons were excluded from the study if they lived outside the United States, qualified for Medicare for reasons other than old age, or were younger than 66 years or older than 100 years in 2015. We further excluded beneficiaries without Part D enrollment because we were unable to identify low-income status. Finally, we excluded persons who did not receive any low-income subsidy under Part D during a period of 120 months from 2006 to 2015. Local Area and Affluence A local area was defined as a CZ, which is a group of counties. This grouping, developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, reflects commuting patterns between home and work in a local area. We chose this level of geographic aggregation because it reflects local economic and social activity ties rather than political boundaries. We used the 1990 CZ delineation, which split the United States into 741 CZs. Our analytic sample did not include 5 CZs in Alaska, restricting our analysis to 736 CZs. Affluence was measured using the median home value in the CZ. House prices incorporate both market and nonmarket (for example, air quality) characteristics of a local area and are an effective summary measure of an area's socioeconomic status (44). We ordered 736 CZs by increasing median house value and divided them into 10 equally sized groups, representing deciles of the median home value distribution. Within each group, we categorized CZs into urban and rural. A CZ was defined as urban if it intersected a metropolitan statistical area. Outcomes A person was recorded to have a chronic condition if the date when they first met CMS diagnosis criteria for this condition was indicated. The CMS diagnosis criteria are based on a combination of diagnostic and procedural codes. Indicators for 57 chronic conditions tracked by CMS were available. We excluded 9 conditions with prevalences less than 0.5 per 100 persons to ensure enough observations for each condition in each CZ. Demographic Variables To ensure sufficient sample size within each demographic cell, we discretized age into the following 5 disjoint intervals: aged 66 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, 80 to 84, and 85 or older. We created indicator variables for being female and white using sex and race records. Statistical Analysis Descriptive data for the whole sample are presented as counts, means, and SDs. Crude prevalence per 100 persons was computed for all 48 conditions in the full sample. Crude CZ-level prevalence was adjusted to account for differences in age, race, and sex across CZs. The adjustment was done using direct standardization (45). Twenty demographic cells were defined for standardization, using all combinations of indicators for 5 age intervals, female, and white. This adjustment method allowed for the relationship between prevalence and age to be CZ-specific and to vary flexibly by age and sex. The standard population distribution was computed empirically from the entire analytic sample. We used factor analysis to assess the spatial covariation of condition prevalences and to aggregate 48 conditions into a composite CZ-level prevalence index. The share of variance explained by the first factor in the factor analysis was used as a measure of covariation across condition prevalences. The composite index was constructed in 2 steps. First, we computed a regression-based score for the first factor in our analysis (46, 47). This score is an optimally weighted linear combination of Z scores of condition prevalences in each CZ. Second, to improve interpretability, we rescaled the standardized CZ-level factor score to be an index with a mean of 100 and an SD of 10. The resulting local area chronic condition index (LACCI) for low-income, older adults can be interpreted in terms of percentage. For example, an LACCI of 150 would suggest that the CZ has a 50% higher composite prevalence of 48 examined conditions relative to an average CZ. In addition to factor analysis, we used a graphical approach to illustrate the extent of spatial covariation of condition prevalence. We first identified the 100 most populous CZs and ordered them by increasing LACCI. We then created a matrix that, for each CZ in rows, recorded the adjusted prevalence of each condition in columns. We used a color scale from blue (low) to red (high) to code relatively higher prevalence of a condition across CZs. If the prevalence of all conditions was correlated within a CZ, we would expect that, for CZs with the lowest LACCI, the prevalence of most conditions should be relatively low and hence the share of blue cells should be high; conversely, for CZs with the highest LACCI, the prevalence of most conditions should be relatively high and thus so should the share of red cells. Finally, we examined the association between LACCI and the deciles of the median home price distribution across CZs. We quantified the magnitude of the association by computing the mean LACCI within each decile separately for urban and rural CZs. We measured the precision of the association using a 2-sided t test that compared the mean LACCI in deciles 1 to 9 with the mean LACCI in decile 10, which had the highest median home values. A P value less than 0.050 was considered statistically significant. We performed several sensitivity analyses. First, we repeated the analysis using multivariable logistic regression for demographic adjustment. Demographic adjusters were included as main effects for 5 age groups and as indicators for being female and white. We included separate indicators for women in each age group and for white women, which allowed age effects to vary by sex and for the sex effect to vary by race. Standard errors were clustered at the CZ level to account for the hierarchical structure of the data. The logistic regression included indicator variables for each CZ. Adjusted prevalence was predicted for each CZ at the mean of demographic groups in the full sample. Second, we repeated the analysis using direct standardization, adjusting for age and sex but not race. Third, we repeated the analyses on a subsample of persons who were reported to live in the same CZ between 2006 and 2015, thus restricting our analysis to those who did not move in the 10 years before our measurement. Fourth, we examined methods other than factor scores for aggregating 48 conditions into an LACCI, such as a linear combination of condition prevalence that uses national prevalence as weights, or a linear combination of standardized condition prevalence with equal weights. All analyses were performed using Stata for Unix 15.1/MP (StataCorp).

Indian agriculture sector provides employment to 50% of the countries workforce. India is the world's largest producer of pulses, rice, wheat, sugarcane, pomegranates etc. The current scenario of agriculture business in India is not up to the mark as expected. There are number of reasons which causes less yield in the agriculture such as unpredictable environmental conditions, excess use of fertilizers (cost is increasing day by day), increased draught frequency and its severity, increasing labor rate, less difference between the income and expenditure, ripeness of soil, influenced suspensions, non-appropriate water management, diseases on crops, invasion of animals and so on. There is need to find the ways which makes the use of Information Technology (IT) concepts and tools wherever possible for increasing automation in the agriculture business, which results in the efficient and effective outcome of agriculture i.e. higher yields. The production efficiency can be increased significantly with technological advancement in agriculture. Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel design approach for precision farming. Farming has seen number of technological transformations in the last decade. By using various smart agriculture gadgets, farmers have gained better control over the process of raising the growing crops and livestocks. One of the major issues which cause fewer yields is the soil health. This paper mainly analyses/reviews the problems related to the soil health (soil fertility), which is a main obstacle in the crop production.

To determine leaf coverage surface, the development of optical micro-sensors that, coupled with a multivariate spectral analysis, will be able to measure the volume of the droplets deposited on their surface is proposed. Rib optical waveguides based on Ge-Se-Te chalcogenide films were manufactured and their light transmission was studied as a response to the deposition of demineralized water droplets on their surface. The measurements were performed using a dedicated spectrophotometric bench to record the transmission spectra at the output of the waveguides, before (reference) and after drop deposition, in the wavelength range between 1200 and 2000 nm. The presence of a hollow at 1450 nm in the relative transmission spectra has been recorded. This corresponds to the first overtone of the O–H stretching vibration in water. This result tends to show that the optical intensity decrease observed after droplet deposition is partly due to absorption by water of the light energy carried by the guided mode evanescent field. The probe based on Ge-Se-Te rib optical waveguides is thus sensitive throughout the whole range of volumes studied, i.e., from 0.1 to 2.5 μL. Principal Component Analysis and Partial Least Square as multivariate techniques then allowed the analysis of the statistics of the measurements and the predictive character of the transmission spectra. It confirmed the sensitivity of the measurement system to the water absorption, and the predictive model allowed the prediction of droplet volumes on an independent set of measurements, with a correlation of 66.5% and a precision of 0.39 μL.",2019,4,0,10.3390/s19194168,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/174a33870d43539e8309ebdf79bd46c4fcc18851,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors

Early detection of plant stress is essential for timely management interventions. Conventional physiological and biochemical methods provide useful information but are often invasive, labour-intensive, and spatially limited. Geophysical imaging methods, particularly electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), offer a non-invasive means of characterizing soil–plant–water interactions in situ. This review examines the principles and applications of ERT and complementary approaches such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electromagnetic induction (EMI), and infrared thermography for monitoring drought responses in plants. Methodological frameworks, case studies, and integration of these tools into precision agriculture are discussed. The review also outlines current limitations, calibration requirements, and potential directions for future research.

Typically, a robot has to navigate along a crop field multiple times during a season for monitoring the plants, for applying agrochemicals, or for performing targeted interventions. In this paper, we propose a visual-based navigation framework tailored to row-crop fields that exploits the regular crop-row structure present in fields. Our approach uses only the images from on-board cameras without the need for performing explicit localization or maintaining a map of the field. Thus, it can operate without expensive RTK-GPS solutions often used in agricultural automation systems. Our navigation approach allows the robot to follow the crop rows accurately and handles the switch to the next row seamlessly within the same framework. We implemented our approach using C++ and ROS and thoroughly tested it in several simulated fields with different shapes and sizes. We also demonstrated the system running at frame-rate on an actual robot operating on a test row-crop field.

An outlook of crop nutrition in the fourth agricultural revolution,"With the world’s population expected to exceed nine billion by 2050, scientists are working to develop new ways to meet rising global demand for food, energy and water without increasing the strain on natural resources. Organisations including the World Bank and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation are calling for more innovation to address the challenges of the agri-food sector. The wide use of synthetic fertilisers has led to negative impacts on the environment and on farmer economies. Innovative cost-effective and eco-compatible strategies are needed in the modern and in the future precision agriculture. This goal could be achieved by reducing the amount of fertilisers applied on crops, in particular, by finding new techniques to distribute the necessary plant nutrients taking into account water and land scarcity, climate change and ecosystems. Nanotechnology is one of six keyenabling technologies that contribute to smart, sustainable competitiveness and inclusive growth in many sectors. It is expected that properly designed nanostructures will allow controlled release of nutrients to synchronise the release with crops nutritional needs. However, the deliberate introduction of nano-sized materials in agricultural activities raises concerns over the possible implications for human health and the environment. The introduction of nanotechnologies in agriculture still need deepen basic and applied knowledge, however several promising results were achieved, so far.

0beb082f63d740b0b12fed0694222588772588e9,NSGA2-based method for band selection for supervised segmentation in hyperspectral imaging,"The identification of crop areas marked by biotic and abiotic factors is a challenge in precision agriculture (PA). Remote sensing and supervised segmentation of hyperspectral images (HIs) have become a fast and precise solution of PA for the identification of problems in crops. However, wellknown problems for knowledge extraction in HIs are related to data volumes and capacity for modeling each phenomenal due to the so-called curse of dimensionality. Some techniques for dealing with dimensionality, such as genetic algorithms (GAs), are promising, but they cannot assure a compromise between the segmentation effectiveness and reduction of dimensionality. In this paper, a multi-objective method based on Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm 2 and Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classifier is proposed for supervised segmentation of HIs dealing with the problem of dimensionality. Experiments with three datasets and cross-validation showed that the proposed method reduced the average number of bands between 75.4% and 88.2% for each evaluation. In addition to reducing the number of bands, statistical tests showed that our method had a pixel classification performance equivalent or more significant than other state-of-the-art methods. Based on the results, the method is promising for band selection in HIs and can contribute to segmentation.",2019,2,0,10.1109/SMC.2019.8913846,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0beb082f63d740b0b12fed0694222588772588e9,"JournalArticle,Conference","IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics"
0d12f67a5e361d623e32bcde325a36b8dd4d7d09,Using UAV During Planned Harvesting by Unmanned Combines,The present article based on the modern tendencies of precision farming development suggests an approach and method of optimal works planning with the employment of UAV for unmanned combine harvesters in terms of harvest collection. The main difference between the developed method from the existing ones is that work planning implies each separate part of the field as a separate unit for the record instead of observing the whole field as a unit. Each separate part is observed with the determination of the scale and density of harvest and building models for the usage of unmanned agricultural machinery based on precise information from the UAV. The process of procedure and time planning for work performance is divided into two main stages: specification of density scale of expected harvest based on the usage of UAV and deciding on the plan of usage of unmanned harvesting equipment. Based on the gathered and processed data from the UAV this information is constantly being updated for a consequent harvesting plan correction. The task of harvest planning is solved by the method of dynamic programming and the criterion of maximization of the scale of gathered harvest with consideration of time and value limits of a harvesting campaign.,2019,11,0,10.1109/apuavd47061.2019.8943842,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d12f67a5e361d623e32bcde325a36b8dd4d7d09,Conference,2019 IEEE 5th International Conference Actual Problems of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Developments (APUAVD)

Data of remote sensing techniques using spectral and thermal approaches have been proposed as potential indicators to allowing rapid identification of crop nitrogen status, water stress and plants diseases across large areas. Given their versatility, remote sensing techniques have become valuable tools for precision agriculture, allowing to farmers to practice a more sustainable agriculture, minimizing risks of losing the harvest by providing the resources (water irrigation and fertilizer) needed to secure yield.

It means that a lot of synthetic chemicals are wasted rather than utilized by crops. This can cause more problems where the soil surface is thin and rocky like Jeju Island in the Republic of Korea. This is because overly used nitrogen fertilizer can be washed into the underground water and pollute it. Thus, it would be important to monitor the nitrogen deficiency of crops in the field to provide the right amount of nitrogen in a timely manner so that nitrogen waste can be limited. To achieve this, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to monitor chlorophyll content, which is tightly associated with nitrogen content in the buckwheat field. The NDVI was calculated with the data obtained by a low-resolution camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle. The results showed that the NDVI can estimate the chlorophyll content of buckwheat. These simple but clear results imply that precision agriculture could be achieved even with a low-resolution camera in a cost-effective manner to reduce the pollution of underground water.",2019,14,1,10.3390/ijerph16203893,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/273d3f3bbc07120c895a87d5df378ff233e5b1b7,JournalArticle,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health

The disease can be caused by pests or maintenance errors. This resulted in a decrease in agricultural production. The decline in production has resulted in a decline in economic yields produced by farmers. Diseases of tomato plants often appear on the leaves. Diseases of tomato leaves have various characteristics. This causes difficulty in identifying diseases automatically. This study aims to identify diseases in leaf images in full automatically without having to define the characteristics and process of segmentation. The method used in this study is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In this study 5 types of leaf disease were used with each type of disease consisting of 1000 image data. This study has successfully identified disease in leaf images automatically with an accuracy of 96.60%.

Otherwise, one relies on subjective and personal evaluations when judgments are required. In particular, color data is one of the essential information in many industrial and daily cases, and, for example, color sensitive optical sensors are useful for estimations of fruits and vegetables in agriculture and in purchases of such products. In this research, in order to lower the price of the sensors with sufficient precision, which is one of the obstacles to extend the application fields, we propose a method to make software calibration for color spectra detected by color sensors using a neural network.

However, farmers argue that it is impossible to produce in medium or large-scale without agrochemicals. On the other hand, the need to reduce the amount of pesticides applied is evident, not just for the risk of overapplication fines, but also for potential savings. In this context, pesticide application has been revolutionized with the use of intelligent sprayers able to control even the places where the spraying is really necessary. Some manufacturers already sell solutions to meet these requirements, but the cost sometimes is so high as to make their use prohibitive in small production properties. Therefore, this work is part of a project started to develop low-cost solutions of precision agriculture, robotics, and autonomous systems accessible to smallholders and family farming. Thus, this paper presents the mathematical modeling to allow pressure and flow control along a boom sprayer with individual nozzle on-off control and serial feed.

The first ICOM was organized in 2001 with an overwhelming response from the researchers from more than ten different countries. So far, the Department of Mechatronics of IIUM has successfully organized six ICOMs. We believe we would be able to maintain the continuity of ICOM from now onwards, inshaAllah. The discipline of Mechatronics has now started to become main stream with most nations including Malaysia started to update its policy to be more industrial 4.0 ready. The discipline now has penetrated into all walks of life with its products alleviating the current standard of life that we have. Specifically, recent advances in mechatronics are being extended from precision agriculture to healthcare. In the recent past, robots were mostly found to be used in the manufacturing industries. Now, with the advancement of mechatronics, the use of robots started to take a firm footing in the areas of underwater robotics, driverless cars, autonomous aerial vehicles, microsurgery, Brain Machine Interaction (BMI) and so on. In the future, robots in various form are expected to be as ubiquitous as what mobile phone is in this century. With this idea forward and considering the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030, we would foresee that Mechatronics discipline would definitely play an active role in pushing forward towards achieving goal number 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure and goal number 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities of the SDGs. Thus, it is my firm believes and expectation that ICOM will be the platform for interaction and exchange of ideas among the scientists and engineers to bring about new knowledge and sustainable technology especially those that links to UN SDGs establishing a better tomorrow for the future generations to come.

While current automated greenhouses focus on controlling and monitoring environmental and soil variables, direct vegetation data is not usually available. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a standardized indicator for crop healthiness, that uses direct plant spectral measurements of the difference between the reflected near-infrared and red light. This paper evaluates two different types of NDVI measurement instruments and analyzes how they can be integrated into a greenhouse ecosystem to control environmental and soil variables based on the plant healthiness.

Nevertheless, there are a few low-cost options to monitor soil moisture. Moreover, those options depend on the specific characteristics of the soil. In this paper, we attempt to find a sensor, based on mutual inductance, that could be used for more than one sort of soil. We study three prototypes, one of them with casing. The sensors are powered with a voltage of 10 peak to peak volts. One of the soils has a high content of organic matter and sand while the other is rich in sand and silt. The best prototype for the soil with high levels of organic matter has 10 turns on the powered coil and 5 on the induced coil. The best frequency for this sensor is 1340 kHz. For the soil with a significant quantity of silt, the best prototype has 80 turns on the powered coil and 40 on the induced coil. The frequency at which this sensor works best is 229 kHz, which happens to be its peak frequency. With those characteristics regressions lines with R2 values higher than 0.75 can be modeled.",2019,4,0,10.1109/iotsms48152.2019.8939258,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c71945c5d1d421642b0acfd8db50257839758e94,"JournalArticle,Conference","International Conference on Internet of Things: Systems, Management and Security"

501b115f38d069374126000a1af1d4bc83e6228e,Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Technology and Applications in Agriculture,"Numerous sensors have been developed over time for precision agriculture; though, only recently have these sensors been incorporated into the new realm of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). This UAS technology has allowed for a more integrated and optimized approach to various farming tasks such as field mapping, plant stress detection, biomass estimation, weed management, inventory counting, and chemical spraying, among others. These systems can be highly specialized depending on the particular goals of the researcher or farmer, yet many aspects of UAS are similar. All systems require an underlying platform—or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)—and one or more peripherals and sensing equipment such as imaging devices (RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, near infra-red, RGB depth), gripping tools, or spraying equipment. Along with these wide-ranging peripherals and sensing equipment comes a great deal of data processing. Common tools to aid in this processing include vegetation indices, point clouds, machine learning models, and statistical methods. With any emerging technology, there are also a few considerations that need to be analyzed like legal constraints, economic trade-offs, and ease of use. This review then concludes with a discussion on the pros and cons of this technology, along with a brief outlook into future areas of research regarding UAS technology in agriculture.",2019,136,3,10.3390/agronomy9100618,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/501b115f38d069374126000a1af1d4bc83e6228e,Review,Agronomy
56c7f8ff241037fad7aeffec37324065131ae702,Automated Mapping of Typical Cropland Strips in the North China Plain Using Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Photogrammetry,"Accurate mapping of agricultural fields is needed for many purposes, including irrigation decisions and cadastral management. This paper is concerned with the automated mapping of cropland strips that are common in the North China Plain. These strips are commonly 3–8 m in width and 50–300 m in length, and are separated by small ridges that assist with irrigation. Conventional surveying methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming for this application, and only limited performance is possible with very high resolution satellite images. Small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) images could provide an alternative approach to ridge detection and strip mapping. This paper presents a novel method for detecting cropland strips, utilizing centimeter spatial resolution imagery captured by sUAS flying at low altitude (60 m). Using digital surface models (DSM) and ortho-rectified imagery from sUAS data, this method extracts candidate ridge locations by surface roughness segmentation in combination with geometric constraints. This method then exploits vegetation removal and morphological operations to refine candidate ridge elements, leading to polyline-based representations of cropland strip boundaries. This procedure has been tested using sUAS data from four typical cropland plots located approximately 60 km west of Jinan, China. The plots contained early winter wheat. The results indicated an ability to detect ridges with comparatively high recall and precision (96.8% and 95.4%, respectively). Cropland strips were extracted with over 98.9% agreement relative to ground truth, with kappa coefficients over 97.4%. To our knowledge, this method is the first to attempt cropland strip mapping using centimeter spatial resolution sUAS images. These results have demonstrated that sUAS mapping is a viable approach for data collection to assist in agricultural land management in the North China Plain.",2019,3,0,10.3390/rs11202343,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/56c7f8ff241037fad7aeffec37324065131ae702,"JournalArticle,Review",Remote Sensing

b13c7871ae4f5e686a3543e3a3b8af78bc18465d,Geometric Characterization of Vines from 3D Point Clouds Obtained with Laser Scanner Systems,"The 3D digital characterization of vegetation is a growing practice in the agronomy sector. Precision agriculture is sustained, among other methods, by variables that remote sensing techniques can digitize. At present, laser scanners make it possible to digitize three-dimensional crop geometry in the form of point clouds. In this work, we developed several methods for calculating the volume of vine wood, with the final intention of using these values as indicators of vegetative vigor on a thematic map. For this, we used a static terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), a mobile scanning system (MMS), and six algorithms that were implemented and adapted to the data captured and to the proposed objective. The results show that, with TLS equipment and the algorithm called convex hull cluster, the volumes of a vine trunk can be obtained with a relative error lower than 7%. Although the accuracy and detail of the cloud obtained with TLS are very high, the cost per unit for the scanned area limits the application of this system for large areas. In contrast to the inoperability of the TLS in large areas of terrain, the MMS and the algorithm based on the L1-medial skeleton and the modelling of cylinders of a certain height and diameter have solved the estimation of volumes with a relative error better than 3%. To conclude, the vigor map elaborated represents the estimated volume of each vine by this method.",2019,19,1,10.3390/rs11202365,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b13c7871ae4f5e686a3543e3a3b8af78bc18465d,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

The focus of this study is on the supply side, i.e. the factors that are perceived by PA firms as obstacles for the expansion of their market.Design/methodology/approachBased on a survey to 67 firms that develop PA technologies in Argentina, this study examines the impact of different types of obstacles on firms’ growth and innovation activities. This analysis is complemented with the results that emerge from a series of interviews with different stakeholders (such as firms’ managers, policymakers and experts).FindingsIn this study, it was determined that market and cost factors negatively affect firms’ growth, while institutional obstacles reduce the amount of innovation efforts. In turn, knowledge barriers positively impact on the relevance firms assigned to R&D activities. This study helps identify different strategies that firms have put in place to overcome the barriers they face. Finally, policy implications of the results are discussed.Originality/valuePA technologies may contribute to greening agricultural production and offer an opportunity for the emergence of domestic suppliers of innovative equipment and services based on the use of data science, artificial intelligence and Internet of Things. To the bets of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that explores the obstacles that prevent growth and impact on innovation activities of PA firms. The insights from this study are valuable for both researchers and policymakers aiming to foster emergence of high-tech clusters in developing countries.",2019,10,0,10.1108/mrjiam-11-2018-0883,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5cd819f4bbb88ce3d49a61cada35fd1a00e800cf,Review,Management Research: Journal of the Iberoamerican Academy of Management
ab24443afa8bdf1d7b10817a1d02f0a6ba316658,Detecting Winter Wheat Irrigation Signals Using SMAP Gridded Soil Moisture Data,"The southern part of the Hebei Province is one of China’s major crop-producing regions. Due to the continuous decline in groundwater level, agricultural water use is facing significant challenges. Precision agricultural irrigation management is undoubtedly an effective way to solve this problem. Based on multisource data (time series soil moisture active passive (SMAP) data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and evapotranspiration (ET), and meteorological station precipitation), the irrigation signal (frequency, timing and area) is detected in the southern part of the Hebei Province. The SMAP data was processed by the 5-point moving average method to reduce the error caused by the uncertainty of the microwave data derived SM. Irrigation signals can be detected by removing the precipitation effect and setting the SM change threshold. Based on the validation results, the overall accuracy of the irrigation signal detection is 77.08%. Simultaneously, considering the spatial resolution limitation of SMAP pixels, the SMAP irrigation area was downscaled using the winter wheat area extracted from MODIS NDVI. The analytical results of 55 winter wheat samples (5 samples in a group) showed that winter wheat covered by one SMAP pixel had an 82.72% growth consistency in surface water irrigation period, which can indicate a downscaling effectiveness. According to the above statistical analysis, this paper considers that although the spatial resolution of SMAP data is insufficient, it can reflect the change of SM more sensitively. In areas where the crop pattern is relatively uniform, the introduction of high-resolution crop pattern distribution can be used not only to detect irrigation signals but also to validate the effectiveness of irrigation signal detection by analyzing crop growth consistency. Therefore, the downscaling results can indicate the true winter wheat irrigation timing, area and frequency in the study area.",2019,11,1,10.3390/rs11202390,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab24443afa8bdf1d7b10817a1d02f0a6ba316658,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

075c17bffc61a115dc50e9f0d8ef0a8812994a42,Method of Area Frame Sampling Using Probability Proportional to Size Sampling Technique for Crops’ Surveys: A Case Study in Pakistan,"The Crops’ estimates have been greatly concerned by the Government of Punjab (Pakistan) all the times. Crop Reporting Service (CRS), Agriculture Department, Punjab, as a unique and the largest statistical organization in Punjab, has been working on agricultural statistics using the sampling technique, List Frame Sampling (LFS), for conducting surveys to gather information regarding crops acreage, cost of production, crops yield and other agricultural items since 1978. The development of the rural economy in Pakistan brings new problems and challenges to the methods of agricultural statistics. The back bone of agricultural statistics is the sampling technique, LFS, in which primary sampling unit is a village and an enumerator has to survey the whole village whatever the size of the village causing an increase in non-sampling error. In spite of the sufficient area coverage, representation of population in the sample is not satisfactory. The solution is Area Frame Sampling Technique in which primary sampling unit is a Segment of a specific acreage covering maximum dimensions of the population land. In this paper a method of Area Frame Sampling (AFS) has been proposed. As most of the research papers focus on the method of AFS through Geographical Information System (GIS) technique. But in this paper two-stage statistical sampling technique has been used to achieve the same objective in an efficient and economical way. In the first stage Probability Proportional to Size Sampling (PPS) has been used. Here size is cropped area of a Union Council (UC), the smallest geographical cluster in Punjab, Pakistan. In the second stage Simple Random Sampling (SRS) has been used. Here Primary Sampling Units are Segments of land of a village. The results show that the problem of non-representation of agricultural land is minimized and, consequently, getting better estimates in terms of precision using less amount of land data. It is recommended that this method can be extended for multiple stages of sampling and for multiple measures of sizes.",2019,6,1,10.9734/jeai/2019/v41i230395,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/075c17bffc61a115dc50e9f0d8ef0a8812994a42,Review,Journal of Experimental Agriculture International
14b59491d8b988692c8615c32ab1bd65cd641f64,"OPeRAte: An IoT Approach towards Collaborative, Manufacturer-independent Farming 4.0","Without modern agricultural technology, it would not be possible to feed the world’s steadily growing population. In order to be able to handle this task in the future, new improvements must be constantly developed to improve agriculture and increase yields. These include methods known as ’Precision Farming’, ’Smart Farming’ or ’Farming 4.0’. These terms describe working in the field with high-tech machines that are supported by intelligent systems that communicate with each other. But at the present time, such intercommunicating ecosystems are manufacturer-bound and hardly interoperable. This paper presents a new approach to connecting various agricultural machines from different manufacturers into a common network of IoT devices. In this project, a framework for the orchestration of agricultural processes is being developed that is capable of planning, controlling, monitoring and documenting joint collaborative tasks between many independent machines while breaking the commitment to a single manufacturer. The first application example of the system is the development of a tank trailer for liquid slurry spreading with various sensors and controls. By using IoT-specific technologies, the tank can already be configured by a process management system, so that exact nutrient quantities are applied part-field-specifically and a legally compliant documentation is generated.",2019,2,0,10.5220/0007760101650176,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14b59491d8b988692c8615c32ab1bd65cd641f64,JournalArticle,"International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security"

The last decade, backscatter communication has been introduced as a cutting-edge technology that could address the above limitations. In high precision agricultural applications, the monitoring of plant-water-stress (PWS) is of high importance for smart sensing. Instead of the traditional ground soil moisture sensing, leaf sensing is an old technology, which is used for the detection of PWS. Considering the above topics, this work aims to mention the development of a novel sensor node/tag for environmental leaf sensing which uses backscattering communication over ambient frequency modulated signals (FM music signals). The work is based on our previous works [1], [2] and it is described how ambient backscatter technology could be exploited for the “one sensor/plant” concept in precision agriculture applications.",2019,9,0,10.1109/APWC.2019.8870568,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/330e0badae8d6aa773bef2e5ad497aed7437118f,Conference,Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications
76323475d0bea30aba464c27ce6a44e62dae1933,Joint Retrieval of Growing Season Corn Canopy LAI and Leaf Chlorophyll Content by Fusing Sentinel-2 and MODIS Images,"Continuous and accurate estimates of crop canopy leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content are of great importance for crop growth monitoring. These estimates can be useful for precision agricultural management and agricultural planning. Our objectives were to investigate the joint retrieval of corn canopy LAI and chlorophyll content using filtered reflectances from Sentinel-2 and MODIS data acquired during the corn growing season, which, being generally hot and rainy, results in few cloud-free Sentinel-2 images. In addition, the retrieved time series of LAI and chlorophyll content results were used to monitor the corn growth behavior in the study area. Our results showed that: (1) the joint retrieval of LAI and chlorophyll content using the proposed joint probability distribution method improved the estimation accuracy of both corn canopy LAI and chlorophyll content. Corn canopy LAI and chlorophyll content were retrieved jointly and accurately using the PROSAIL model with fused Kalman filtered (KF) reflectance images. The relation between retrieved and field measured LAI and chlorophyll content of four corn-growing stages had a coefficient of determination (R2) of about 0.6, and root mean square errors (RMSEs) ranges of mainly 0.1–0.2 and 0.0–0.3, respectively. (2) Kalman filtering is a good way to produce continuous high-resolution reflectance images by synthesizing Sentinel-2 and MODIS reflectances. The correlation between fused KF and Sentinel-2 reflectances had an R2 value of 0.98 and RMSE of 0.0133, and the correlation between KF and field-measured reflectances had an R2 value of 0.8598 and RMSE of 0.0404. (3) The derived continuous KF reflectances captured the crop behavior well. Our analysis showed that the LAI increased from day of year (DOY) 181 (trefoil stage) to DOY 236 (filling stage), and then increased continuously until harvest, while the chlorophyll content first also increased from DOY 181 to DOY 236, and then remained stable until harvest. These results revealed that the jointly retrieved continuous LAI and chlorophyll content could be used to monitor corn growth conditions.",2019,10,0,10.3390/rs11202409,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/76323475d0bea30aba464c27ce6a44e62dae1933,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing

In this paper, the image segmentation algorithm of maize smut, Maize Head Smut and maize rust, which are three main diseases and insect pests, is studied by taking the high-yield crop Maize in Northeast China as an example. The image background in the static image editing is replaced by an improved one-time cutting algorithm. Through the adaptive combination of weights, the depth information and saliency information are combined into the grabbing color model. The improved image segmentation algorithm greatly improves the efficiency and accuracy of image segmentation, and achieves a good spot segmentation effect in the static image of corn pests and diseases, and has a high recognition.

7fc4dcc3878eccf4abaa11784b5251b5e24ead64,Improving Field-Scale Wheat LAI Retrieval Based on UAV Remote-Sensing Observations and Optimized VI-LUTs,"Leaf area index (LAI) is a key biophysical parameter for monitoring crop growth status, predicting crop yield, and quantifying crop variability in agronomic applications. Mapping the LAI at the field scale using multispectral cameras onboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a promising precision-agriculture application with specific requirements: The LAI retrieval method should be (1) robust so that crop LAI can be estimated with similar accuracy and (2) easy to use so that it can be applied to the adjustment of field management practices. In this study, three UAV remote-sensing missions (UAVs with Micasense RedEdge-M and Cubert S185 cameras) were carried out over six experimental plots from 2018 to 2019 to investigate the performance of reflectance-based lookup tables (LUTs) and vegetation index (VI)-based LUTs generated from the PROSAIL model for wheat LAI retrieval. The effects of the central wavelengths and bandwidths for the VI calculations on the LAI retrieval were further examined. We found that the VI-LUT strategy was more robust and accurate than the reflectance-LUT strategy. The differences in the LAI retrieval accuracy among the four VI-LUTs were small, although the improved modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index-lookup table (MCARI2-LUT) and normalized difference vegetation index-lookup table (NDVI-LUT) performed slightly better. We also found that both of the central wavelengths and bandwidths of the VIs had effects on the LAI retrieval. The VI-LUTs with optimized central wavelengths (red = 612 nm, near-infrared (NIR) = 756 nm) and narrow bandwidths (~4 nm) improved the wheat LAI retrieval accuracy (R2 ≥ 0.75). The results of this study provide an alternative method for retrieving crop LAI, which is robust and easy use for precision-agriculture applications and may be helpful for designing UAV multispectral cameras for agricultural monitoring.",2019,46,1,10.3390/rs11202456,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7fc4dcc3878eccf4abaa11784b5251b5e24ead64,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing
9381e56a16a2bcea6137e9344581aeba6a6c437d,Analysis of Vegetation Characteristics of Regional Soybean and Paddy Rice Fields Using UAV Images and Farm Maps,"Remote sensing (RS) and GIS together provide an efficient and inexpensive way to assess vegetation characteristics and cultivated areas. Precision vegetation mapping provides important information for understanding crop conditions through the calculation of the vegetation index. In this study, a multispectral sensor was installed on an eBee (Sensefly), which is suitable for wide area photography taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). UAV imagery acquisition was used to obtain spatial information on soybean and paddy rice cultivation areas in a wider region. The study area selected was Gimje, which is in the southwest of South Korea. Based on the designation of main areas according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (MAFRA), the area was selected considering the cultivation area, production volume, number of farm households, and self-sufficiency ratio. The main producing areas are soybean cultivation areas defined as a city or county with a cultivation area of 30∼1500 ha or more, respectively. The identification of the cultivation area of soybeans was made based on images taken in early September, when the growth characteristics of soybeans were clearly distinguished from other crops. The accuracy of the soybean and paddy rice cultivation area identification was improved by using the farm map (FM) prepared by the MAFRA in South Korea. The NDVI was analyzed based on the two periods of high growth activity of soybean and paddy rice. The accuracy of the cultivated area was improved by using the UAV images and the FM prepared by the MAFRA. As a result, this study shows that UAV images can be used more effectively by linking GIS with the FM as a basic map.",2019,1,0,10.1088/1757-899X/611/1/012086,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9381e56a16a2bcea6137e9344581aeba6a6c437d,Conference,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering
bb3783baf9a6c7852074047eba66e30970074759,High-Precision Estimation of Steering Angle of Agricultural Tractors Using GPS and Low-Accuracy MEMS,"Precision agriculture, such as precise seeding or ploughing, is guaranteed by vehicle navigation accuracy. A steering angle plays an essential and fundamental role in the function of autonomous vehicle and the path planning because it controls the vehicle direction. However, the steering angle cannot be calibrated directly from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) due to the limitation of GNSS parameters. In addition, the accuracy of steering angle obtained from the analysis of Global Position System (GPS) information cannot satisfy the accuracy requirements in engineering applications. In this paper, a novel approach to improve accuracy of steering angle is proposed. Low-cost Micro-electromechanical System (MEMS) and GPS are combined on an agriculture vehicle so that the steering angle can be calculated precisely. Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF) are used in simulations to estimate the steering angle. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve increased accuracy of estimation of steering angle than that based merely on GPS information. Because the cost of a MEMS gyroscope is very low, the proposed method is a practical way to achieve precision agriculture with high accuracy.",2019,15,0,10.1109/TVT.2019.2949298,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bb3783baf9a6c7852074047eba66e30970074759,JournalArticle,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology
c930c7b34ef70196d2aaa5c514056f6f2650758b,Adoption Determinants of Modern Rice Cultivars among Smallholders of Northern Iran,"Several agronomic innovations and precision technologies have been developed and disseminated in rice cultivation, but adoption is often lagged, particularly in developing countries. The objective of this work was to collect information on the use of improved rice cultivars and factors affecting adoption through a farmers’ survey in Guilan Province, northern Iran. About 4 out of 10 farmers (42.8%) used improved rice cultivars. Above half of the farmers (55.2%) recognized the high profitability of this technology and half (49.8%) realized that modern rice cultivars are of great importance. However, there were some farmers who perceived no profitability (14.8%) or no importance (12.5%) regarding this technology. Additionally, 9.8% were not aware of the profitability, and 16.2% were not aware of the importance of the technology. The majority of the farmers (60.5%) collaborated with fellow farmers about common production problems. Nevertheless, low cooperation with extension agents was noted for 58.5% of the farmers and low attendance of local agricultural offices activities was noted for 59.8% of the farmers. A logistic regression analysis showed that perceived profitability and perceived importance of modern varieties, background in rice farming, and size of livestock holdings were positively associated with the adoption of improved cultivars. It can be concluded that the low acceptance of modern rice cultivars in the study area is related to current farming socio-economic conditions. Dissemination of information on improved cultivars from experienced farmers to other farmers should be considered to promote adoption, along with financial incentives to low-income farmers.",2019,13,0,10.3390/agriculture9110232,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c930c7b34ef70196d2aaa5c514056f6f2650758b,Review,Agriculture
5a0ba7300979f413ccfb1c90a95f3558d53ea5b9,Ubiquitous supercomputing: design and development of enabling technologies for multi-robot systems rethinking supercomputing,"Supercomputing, also known as High Performance Computing (HPC), is almost everywhere (ubiquitous), from the small widget in your phone telling you that today will be a sunny day, up to the next great contribution to the understanding of the origins of the universe.However, there is a field where supercomputing has been only slightly explored - robotics. Other than attempts to optimize complex robotics tasks, the two forces lack an effective alignment and a purposeful long-term contract. With advancements in miniaturization, communications and the appearance of powerful, energy and weight optimized embedded computing boards, a next logical transition corresponds to the creation of clusters of robots, a set of robotic entities that behave similarly as a supercomputer does. Yet, there is key aspect regarding our current understanding of what supercomputing means, or is useful for, that this work aims to redefine. For decades, supercomputing has been solely intended as a computing efficiency mechanism i.e. decreasing the computing time for complex tasks. While such train of thought have led to countless findings, supercomputing is more than that, because in order to provide the capacity of solving most problems quickly, another complete set of features must be provided, a set of features that can also be exploited in contexts such as robotics and that ultimately transform a set of independent entities into a cohesive unit.This thesis aims at rethinking what supercomputing means and to devise strategies to effectively set its inclusion within the robotics realm, contributing therefore to the ubiquity of supercomputing, the first main ideal of this work. With this in mind, a state of the art concerning previous attempts to mix robotics and HPC will be outlined, followed by the proposal of High Performance Robotic Computing (HPRC), a new concept mapping supercomputing to the nuances of multi-robot systems. HPRC can be thought as supercomputing in the edge and while this approach will provide all kind of advantages, in certain applications it might not be enough since interaction with external infrastructures will be required or desired. To facilitate such interaction, this thesis proposes the concept of ubiquitous supercomputing as the union of HPC, HPRC and two more type of entities, computing-less devices (e.g. sensor networks, etc.) and humans.The results of this thesis include the ubiquitous supercomputing ontology and an enabling technology depicted as The ARCHADE. The technology serves as a middleware between a mission and a supercomputing infrastructure and as a framework to facilitate the execution of any type of mission, i.e. precision agriculture, entertainment, inspection and monitoring, etc. Furthermore, the results of the execution of a set of missions are discussed.By integrating supercomputing and robotics, a second ideal is targeted, ubiquitous robotics, i.e. the use of robots in all kind of applications. Correspondingly, a review of existing ubiquitous robotics frameworks is presented and based upon its conclusions, The ARCHADE's design and development have followed the guidelines for current and future solutions. Furthermore, The ARCHADE is based on a rethought supercomputing where performance is not the only feature to be provided by ubiquitous supercomputing systems. However, performance indicators will be discussed, along with those related to other supercomputing features.Supercomputing has been an excellent ally for scientific exploration and not so long ago for commercial activities, leading to all kind of improvements in our lives, in our society and in our future. With the results of this thesis, the joining of two fields, two forces previously disconnected because of their philosophical approaches and their divergent backgrounds, holds enormous potential to open up our imagination for all kind of new applications and for a world where robotics and supercomputing are everywhere.
 La supercomputación, también conocida como Computación de Alto Rendimiento (HPC por sus siglas en inglés) puede encontrarse en casi cualquier lugar (ubicua), desde el widget en tu teléfono diciéndote que hoy será un día soleado, hasta la siguiente gran contribución al entendimiento de los orígenes del universo. Sin embargo, hay un campo en el que ha sido poco explorada - la robótica. Más allá de intentos de optimizar tareas robóticas complejas, las dos fuerzas carecen de un contrato a largo plazo. Dado los avances en miniaturización, comunicaciones y la aparición de potentes computadores embebidos, optimizados en peso y energía, la siguiente transición corresponde a la creación de un cluster de robots, un conjunto de robots que se comportan de manera similar a un supercomputador. No obstante, hay un aspecto clave, con respecto a la comprensión de la supercomputación, que esta tesis pretende redefinir. Durante décadas, la supercomputación ha sido entendida como un mecanismo de eficiencia computacional, es decir para reducir el tiempo de computación de ciertos problemas extremadamente complejos. Si bien este enfoque ha conducido a innumerables hallazgos, la supercomputación es más que eso, porque para proporcionar la capacidad de resolver todo tipo de problemas rápidamente, se debe proporcionar otro conjunto de características que también pueden ser explotadas en la robótica y que transforman un conjunto de robots en una unidad cohesiva. Esta tesis pretende repensar lo que significa la supercomputación y diseñar estrategias para establecer su inclusión dentro del mundo de la robótica, contribuyendo así a su ubicuidad, el principal ideal de este trabajo. Con esto en mente, se presentará un estado del arte relacionado con intentos anteriores de mezclar robótica y HPC, seguido de la propuesta de Computación Robótica de Alto Rendimiento (HPRC, por sus siglas en inglés), un nuevo concepto, que mapea la supercomputación a los matices específicos de los sistemas multi-robot. HPRC puede pensarse como supercomputación en el borde y si bien este enfoque proporcionará todo tipo de ventajas, ciertas aplicaciones requerirán una interacción con infraestructuras externas. Para facilitar dicha interacción, esta tesis propone el concepto de supercomputación ubicua como la unión de HPC, HPRC y dos tipos más de entidades, dispositivos sin computación embebida y seres humanos. Los resultados de esta tesis incluyen la ontología de la supercomputación ubicua y una tecnología llamada The ARCHADE. La tecnología actúa como middleware entre una misión y una infraestructura de supercomputación y como framework para facilitar la ejecución de cualquier tipo de misión, por ejemplo, agricultura de precisión, inspección y monitoreo, etc. Al integrar la supercomputación y la robótica, se busca un segundo ideal, robótica ubicua, es decir el uso de robots en todo tipo de aplicaciones. Correspondientemente, una revisión de frameworks existentes relacionados serán discutidos. El diseño y desarrollo de The ARCHADE ha seguido las pautas y sugerencias encontradas en dicha revisión. Además, The ARCHADE se basa en una supercomputación repensada donde la eficiencia computacional no es la única característica proporcionada a sistemas basados en la tecnología. Sin embargo, se analizarán indicadores de eficiencia computacional, junto con otros indicadores relacionados con otras características de la supercomputación. La supercomputación ha sido un excelente aliado para la exploración científica, conduciendo a todo tipo de mejoras en nuestras vidas, nuestra sociedad y nuestro futuro. Con los resultados de esta tesis, la unión de dos campos, dos fuerzas previamente desconectadas debido a sus enfoques filosóficos y sus antecedentes divergentes, tiene un enorme potencial para abrir nuestra imaginación hacia todo tipo de aplicaciones nuevas y para un mundo donde la robótica y la supercomputación estén en todos lados",2019,0,0,10.5821/dissertation-2117-171404,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5a0ba7300979f413ccfb1c90a95f3558d53ea5b9,Review,

Although there has been many agro-knowledge and information systems for famers, but a little information in integrating among agriculture, IoT and field monitoring systems (FMS) technology for farmers in Indonesia. RiTx or Agricultural Technology is one of application for farmers with integrating among agriculture, IoT and field monitoring system technology. RiTx provides realtime, localized soil and weather data and field-level agronomic intelligence, which support farmers to decide their decisions during planting until harvesting, so failure during planting season can be eliminated. The province of East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) is cluster of islands located in the south – eastern part of Indonesia. The monsoon season stretches from October to March each year. Outside of the monsoon season, the climate of NTT is relatively dry. This study focuses on applying FMS technology with IoT for agricultural precision. For this study, field monitoring system was set up in the field since 26 July 2017 in Kupang, NTT Province that is consisted of three main components, i.e., FieldRouter, Datalogger and the sensors. Here, there are several sensors that have been installed in the field, e.g., solar radiation, rain-gauge and soil moisture. As the results, the IT field monitoring system showed good performance and reliable for precision agriculture. The actual field conditions were monitored well in term of image, numeric, and graphical data acquisition. Based on monitored data, plant growth can be well monitored. In addition, dynamic changes of environmental parameters can be monitored as well. Finally, it can help farmers in the future, not only in Indonesia or South-East Asia but also in the world, so prosperity for farmers can be granted.",2019,4,0,10.1088/1755-1315/335/1/012022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac01da528e32e530dd26a8caae9295c935a651d1,Conference,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environment

The goal is to make farming more efficient and productive with the least impact on the environment. This paper proposes an architectural model for evaluation of soil fertility and productivity using contexts history based on chemical and physical aspects that characterize different types of soil over the time in a sustainable way.

On the basis of the IoT platform, web‐based systems and services are been developing such as e‐surveillance, industrial‐IoT, and precision agriculture. For farmland monitoring systems, WSSNs need to be scalable in terms of coverage area. Sensor nodes are energy‐constrained devices, and hence, many energy‐efficient clustering protocols are developed in the literature. But these methods overload the cluster leaders (CLs) with cluster computation and data communication costs. An improper CL selection may lead to the early death of such nodes and hence does not prolong the network lifetime stability. We propose a fuzzy logic (FL)–based distributed clustering protocol to enhance the energy efficiency of WSSN while maximizing the coverage area. The load of CLs is shared by originators and super‐CLs (SCLs) selected in the network. The wireless link and received signal strength (RSS) are greatly affected by environmental conditions and thus cannot be considered as ideal network parameters. We use FL systems to tackle the uncertainty of such network parameters. The proposed protocol is simulated for different scalable WSSNs. The results indicate that the proposed protocol provides better lifetime stability than the recent conventional protocols. The functionalities of the protocol are proposed considering the recent wireless standards. Hence, the proposed protocol can be suitably implemented for farmland monitoring systems.",2019,15,0,10.1002/dac.4239,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b83e88a27e0b6b636d7dd6321287b9c1a98cb14,JournalArticle,International Journal of Communication Systems

In particular, image time-series data are often fit to functions called shape models that are used to derive phenological transition dates or predict yield. This paper aimed to investigate the impact of imaging frequency on model fitting and estimation of corn phenological transition timing. Images (PlanetScope 4-band surface reflectance) and in situ measurements (Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) and leaf area index (LAI)) were collected over a corn field in the mid-Atlantic during the 2018 growing season. Correlation was performed between candidate vegetation indices and SPAD and LAI measurements. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was chosen for shape model fitting based on the ground truth correlation and initial fitting results. Plot-average NDVI time-series were cleaned and fit to an asymmetric double sigmoid function, from which the day of year (DOY) of six different function parameters were extracted. These points were related to ground-measured phenological stages. New time-series were then created by removing images from the original time-series, so that average temporal spacing between images ranged from 3 to 24 days. Fitting was performed on the resampled time-series, and phenological transition dates were recalculated. Average range of estimated dates increased by 1 day and average absolute deviation between dates estimated from original and resampled time-series data increased by 1/3 of a day for every day of increase in average revisit interval. In the context of this study, higher imaging frequency led to greater precision in estimates of shape model fitting parameters used to estimate corn phenological transition timing.",2019,15,0,10.3390/rs11212558,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/51c8138e8a9685176345d57523e4c5fa6c4ba43d,JournalArticle,Remote Sensing
195bb9f5cfbf3cfa64765dea7b272bdfccb0911c,A Simple LC–MS Method for the Quantitation of Alkaloids in Endophyte-Infected Perennial Ryegrass,"The rapid identification and quantitation of alkaloids produced by Epichloë endophyte-infected pasture grass is important for the agricultural industry. Beneficial alkaloids, such as peramine, provide the grass with enhanced insect protection. Conversely, ergovaline and lolitrem B can negatively impact livestock. Currently, a single validated method to measure these combined alkaloids in planta does not exist. Here, a simple two-step extraction method was developed for Epichloë-infected perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Peramine, ergovaline and lolitrem B were quantified using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). Alkaloid linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), accuracy, precision, selectivity, recovery, matrix effect and robustness were all established. The validated method was applied to eight different ryegrass-endophyte symbiota. Robustness was established by comparing quantitation results across two additional instruments; a triple quadruple mass spectrometer (QQQ MS) and by fluorescence detection (FLD). Quantitation results were similar across all three instruments, indicating good reproducibility. LOQ values ranged from 0.8 ng/mL to 6 ng/mL, approximately one hundred times lower than those established by previous work using FLD (for ergovaline and lolitrem B), and LC–MS (for peramine). This work provides the first highly sensitive quantitative LC–MS method for the accurate and reproducible quantitation of important endophyte-derived alkaloids.",2019,18,1,10.3390/toxins11110649,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/195bb9f5cfbf3cfa64765dea7b272bdfccb0911c,JournalArticle,Toxins

One way to reduce the cost of chemicals and environmental impact is to allocate the right doses of herbicide to the right place and at the right time (precision agriculture). Nowadays, automatic weeds detection is one of the most challenging problem for precision agriculture. However, weeds and crop are hard to discriminate because of their strong similarities. One of the approaches used for weed detection is machine learning. The main common point between machine learning algorithms is the need of training data. In this article we propose to use deep features and one-class classification on unsupervised data for weed detection in UAV images. The results show that one-class classification can be comparable to the literature and also to a deep learning model trained with supervised training data labeling. Results obtained on all test datasets can be up to 90% depending on the data used for the training.",2019,16,1,10.1109/IPTA.2019.8936091,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f24e53859238714a7070154df7e0e50069119ca,"JournalArticle,Conference",International Conference on Image Processing Theory Tools and Applications

The methodology is based on calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its analysis at different stages of agricultural production. The authors propose an original method and new algorithms for detecting inhomogeneities that take into account field zoning at various stages of the plant development cycle: preparing the field for sowing, emergence and development of seedlings, heading. A mathematical description of the agricultural field as an object of study is given, as well as characteristics of inhomogeneities at each stage of agricultural development. The developed algorithms are used in the Smart Farming system, designed to solve the problems of precision farming in the image processing software module.

2ec5f0a71ffab30cf4a252de4733aecd6aea1768,A Review on blockchain applications in the agri-food sector.,"Food security can benefit from the technology's transparency, relatively low transaction costs and instantaneous applications. A blockchain is a distributed database of records in the form of encrypted blocks, or a public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties and can be verified at any time in the future. Generally, the robust and decentralized functionality of the blockchain is used for global financial systems, but it can easily be expanded to contracts and operations such as tracking of the global supply chain. In the precision agriculture context, Information and Communications Technology can be further implemented with a blockchain infrastructure to enable new farm systems and e-agriculture schemes. The purpose of this review is to show a panorama of the scientific studies (enriched by a terms mapping analysis) on the use of blockchain in the agri-food sector, from both an entirely computational and an applicative point of view. As evidenced by the network analysis, the reviewed studies mainly focused on software aspects (e.g., the architecture and smart contracts). However, some aspects regarding the different blockchain knots (computers always connected to the blockchain network) having the role to store and distribute an updated copy of each block in a food supply-chain, result of crucial importance. These technologies appear very promising and rich of great potential showing a good flexibility for applications in several sectors but still immature and hard to apply due to their complexity.

The presented approach involves deployment of field harvesters equipped with sensors that provide more detailed and spatially localized values than merely a sum of yields for the whole plot. The measurements from such sensors need to be filtered and subject to further processing, including interpolation, to facilitate follow-up interpretation. This paper aims to identify the relative differences between interpolations from (1) (field) measured data, (2) measured data that were globally filtered, and (3) measured data that were globally and locally filtered. All the measured data were obtained at a fully operational farm and are considered to represent a natural experiment.

7cfc18e81a7eca4ac413b2c77653e6dcb949ad69,Geographic Object-Based Analysis of Airborne Multispectral Images for Health Assessment of Capsicum annuum L. Crops,"Vegetation health assessment by using airborne multispectral images throughout crop production cycles, among other precision agriculture technologies, is an important tool for modern agriculture practices. However, to really take advantage of crop fields imagery, specialized analysis techniques are needed. In this paper we present a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach to examine a set of very high resolution (VHR) multispectral images obtained by the use of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to evaluate plant health states and to generate cropland maps for Capsicum annuum L. The scheme described here integrates machine learning methods with semi-automated training and validation, which allowed us to develop an algorithmic sequence for the evaluation of plant health conditions at individual sowing point clusters over an entire parcel. The features selected at the classification stages are based on phenotypic traits of plants with different health levels. Determination of areas without data dependencies for the algorithms employed allowed us to execute some of the calculations as parallel processes. Comparison with the standard normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and biological analyses were also performed. The classification obtained showed a precision level of about 95% in discerning between vegetation and non-vegetation objects, and clustering efficiency ranging from 79% to 89% for the evaluation of different vegetation health categories, which makes our approach suitable for being incorporated at C. annuum crop’s production systems, as well as to other similar crops. This methodology can be reproduced and adjusted as an on-the-go solution to get a georeferenced plant health estimation.",2019,9,0,10.3390/s19214817,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7cfc18e81a7eca4ac413b2c77653e6dcb949ad69,JournalArticle,Italian National Conference on Sensors
85f144836933d0337ff1234b9cfe2df9bd9474cf,The Effect of Behaviour and Diet on the Rumen Temperature of Holstein Bulls,"Simple Summary The use of precision technology within agriculture is growing rapidly. Rumen temperature boluses are primarily used for the detection of ill health, but also have uses in detecting estrus and the onset of parturition. Research has shown that water intake and diet can impact rumen temperature. However, little emphasis has been placed on the impact of behaviour, particularly agonistic interactions, which are common amongst young bulls. In fact, there is a clear knowledge gap surrounding the effect behaviour has on physiology, particularly core body temperature. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the impact of behaviour and diet on the rumen temperature of Holstein bulls, both at grass, and in a housed environment. The results from this study indicate that although significant differences in rumen temperature exist between behaviour groups, these rumen temperatures are all within the normal temperature range. Therefore, behaviour should not impact the accuracy of the detection of ill health. Furthermore, diet had no effect on rumen temperature. Abstract Rumen temperature boluses are becoming increasingly used as a means of monitoring core body temperature for the detection of ill health. However, the effect of behavior on rumen temperature is largely unknown. This research investigates the impact of behaviour and diet on the rumen temperature of Holstein bulls, both at grass, and in a housed environment. Rumen temperature was recorded at five-minute intervals using a bolus. Direct observations were conducted on young bulls in two studies (i) at grass (n = 30) and (ii) while housed (n = 32). In addition, activity monitors were attached to bulls at grass (n = 24). Within each study, diet differed by the level of concentrate supplementation. There was no effect of diet on rumen temperature. Significant differences in rumen temperature were observed between behaviour groups for bulls at grass (p < 0.001) and housed (p < 0.001). Furthermore, drinking resulted in the lowest rumen temperature (grass 35.97 °C; housed 36.70 °C). Therefore, rumen temperature is affected by behavior; however, the temperatures recorded were not outside the normal temperature range for healthy cattle.",2019,11,1,10.3390/ani9111000,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/85f144836933d0337ff1234b9cfe2df9bd9474cf,JournalArticle,Animals

Smart glasses for augmented reality are a new technology that may assist workers in many operations, allowing them to visualize, in the glasses’ lens, diverse information related to a single subject (e.g., animal, plant, feed stock, machinery) or to receive assistance in real-time through video-calls. Using commercially available smart glasses, we explored their potential usefulness in livestock farms. The device was tested using all the functions available in different conditions, both in laboratory and open field environments. The results obtained highlighted the important contribution to assist workers in on-farm daily activities, thanks to the clear and rapid data visualization and to the good quality of audio-video streaming. Specifically, smart glasses enable real time file consulting, data collection, data sharing and remote assistance, all done while working hands-free. Abstract The growing interest in Augmented Reality (AR) systems is becoming increasingly evident in all production sectors. However, to the authors’ knowledge, a literature gap has been found with regard to the application of smart glasses for AR in the agriculture and livestock sector. In fact, this technology allows farmers to manage animal husbandry in line with precision agriculture principles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of an AR head-wearable device as a valuable and integrative tool in precision livestock farming. In this study, the GlassUp F4 Smart Glasses (F4SG) for AR were explored. Laboratory and farm tests were performed to evaluate the implementation of this new technology in livestock farms. The results highlighted several advantages of F4SG applications in farm activities. The clear and fast readability of the information related to a single issue, combined with the large number of readings that SG performed, allowed F4SG adoption even in large farms. In addition, the 7 h of battery life and the good quality of audio-video features highlighted their valuable attitude in remote assistance, supporting farmers on the field. Nevertheless, other studies are required to provide more findings for future development of software applications specifically designed for agricultural purposes.",2019,53,5,10.3390/ani9110903,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/88f2f9813c78c3ffb5a56bb0af58818c8e9fafa0,JournalArticle,Animals

For this problem, the traditional methods include the average value method, the finite element method, and the Kriging method, among which the Kriging method has the highest accuracy, but requires the highest complexity, preventing its applications in large-scale scenes. To overcome this drawback, a two-stage constructing method is developed, which divides all the pixels into two classes, called 1-level pixels and 2-level pixels respectively. For the 1-level pixels, it still uses the Kriging method to estimate the corresponding temperatures (to ensure accuracy). Based on estimated temperatures of the 1-level pixels, for the 2-level pixels it uses a local weighted mean method with low complexity to estimate the corresponding temperatures (to improve efficiency). Experimental results show that, the new method could greatly improve the efficiency of calculation, only with very few loss of accuracy, thus satisfying the real-time requirement in large-scale cases.",2019,0,0,10.1109/ICEMI46757.2019.9101772,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a0f611cd314b96dee26f775689475c60528950b0,Conference,IEEE International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments

The use of agrochemicals is necessary for effective weed control, but one of the great challenges of precision agriculture is to reduce their use while maintaining high crop yields. Recently, automated weed control techniques based on computer vision were developed despite experiencing difficulties in creating agricultural datasets. One possible solution to the small volume of data available is Data Augmentation. This paper investigates the impact of individual data augmentation transformations on the pixel-level classification of crops and weeds when using a Deep Learning model. It also investigates the influence of input image resolution on the classification performance and proposes a patch augmentation strategy. Results have shown that applying individual transformations can be valuable to the model, but gets outperformed by the combination of all transformations. This work also finds that higher resolution inputs can increase the classification performance when combined with augmentation techniques, and that patch augmentation can be a valuable asset when dealing with a small number of high-resolution images. The method reaches the mark of 83.44% in Average Dice Similarity Coefficient, an increase of 19.96% percentage points compared to the non-augmented model.",2019,27,5,10.1109/LA-CCI47412.2019.9037044,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a86b46c5fb76681ecad9bb2bdc10d8eea4eddfbd,"JournalArticle,Conference",Latin American Conference on Computational Intelligence

The concept of PF can be used in all aspects of the crop production cycle from soil testing to harvesting. Soil Testing is a phase to test the conditions of the suitability of the soil to certain varieties. The land suitability variables used are soil type, slope, and altitude. However, the data was stored on other sources with different platforms and web service is the answer to this issue. This paper will approach the Soil Testing phase using the type of spatial data that can be used as a variable in determining land suitability for particular vegetation, which is using web service technology to collect the data.

RTK-GNSS is a key technology in providing centimeter-level accuracy for those applications. However, reliable and cost-effective RTK-GNSS applications and infrastructure are still lacking. Thus, in this paper, we discuss how a reliable and cost-saving RTK-GNSS infrastructure can be designed, deployed and accomplished by using available technologies and tools. We developed a prototyping device equipped with RTK-GNSS receiver, cellular modem, sensors, and movable energy supply modules that include a solar panel as a self-sustainable power source. In our design, different sensors are used to monitor and control the physical status of the base station through Internet. We conducted two experiments in different weather and geographical conditions where our result shows that the consistency of the cm-level accuracy is around 91% in both areas. Similarly, the reliability of the system is maintained by the sensors' data that are visualized graphically in real-time through Internet. After analyzing the experimented results, and mechanism of the base station status update and control system, we conclude that the accuracy, feasibility, and reliability can be achieved even by using a low-cost RTK-GNSS receiver with sensors network.

Energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) can be a powerful tool for this purpose. In this study a huge diverse soil set (n = 598) from 12 different study sites in Germany was analysed with EDXRF. First, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify possible similarities among the sample set. Clustering was observed within the four texture classes clay, loam, silt and sand, as clay samples contain high and sandy soils low iron mass fractions. Furthermore, the potential of uni- and multivariate data evaluation with partial least squares regression (PLSR) was assessed for accurate determination of nutrients in German agricultural samples using two calibration sample sets. Potassium and iron were chosen for testing the performance of both models. Prediction of these nutrients in 598 German soil samples with EDXRF was more accurate using PLSR which is confirmed by a better overall averaged deviation and PLSR should therefore be preferred.",2019,13,0,10.1038/s41598-019-53426-5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc6cf8d81831afd2298400386b7f267041975f5d,JournalArticle,Scientific Reports

It has a predominant role in improving the economic development of our nation. In recent days due to the changes in weather pattern, the crop cultivation has become the greatest challenge. This directly or indirectly affects the productivity of the crops. Hence to overcome from this and to the improve productivity of the crops new technologies can be brought up for usage. The usage of these new technologies will convert traditional farming practices into precision farming. The new technology specified here includes the data analysis and Internet of Things (IoT). As it is revealed that it improves the productivity of the crops by maintaining the finest crop health. Although changes had been adopted in the recent agricultural practices the major issue yet not gets resolved. One such main issue yet to be resolved is cultivating precise crop at the precise time. This can be done with the help of deep learning algorithm such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is found to be an effective one for predicting the precise crop. Hence the proposed system aims at helping the farmers by providing valuable insights to them. These insights can be driven with the help of parameters such as soil moisture level, humidity, temperature and pH collected from the sensors using IoT. In addition to these other parameters include soil type, land type, and the area sown. The crop prediction Graphical User Interface (GUI) system will take these valuable inputs and give suggestions using the crop suggestion user interface.

In addition, it hosts a large, rapidly growing population which depends on agriculture and the world's largest irrigation scheme. In fact, it is challenging to get into deeper understanding of snow and glacier fed Upper Indus catchment that contributes to the water system of the country. Integrating Remote Sensing abilities and Geographic Information System techniques with hydrological modelling approach is very useful to simulate the impact of climate on water resources, understand problems and enhances the methods of investigation for better decision support system. It has been proven to be an effective tool for managing large and complex database, thus providing a digital depiction of catchment characteristics. It is a supportive tool in attaining higher accuracy from hydrological models, thus gives reliable outcomes for the betterment. Therefore, it is essential that the hydrological response of a catchment must be appraised. In the present study, to simulate the daily discharge of the North facing Astore Basin in the Northern-Pakistan, SRM+G (Snowmelt Runoff Model +Glacier) hydrological model was used. For this, SRTM Digital Elevation Model, MODIS snow cover daily product. RFE (Rainfall Estimation) 2.0 for precipitation and LANDSAT 8 for glacier cover were considered. Data extraction and pre-processing was done using R-script to put into the model. The variation in temperature, precipitation (snowmelt and rainfall) and glacier melt influences the overall runoff generation. The results obtained suggest that the SRM+G can be efficiently used as the statistical and hydrograph results are within the acceptable range for both the calibration and validation period (2006–2010).

Among the most popular LPWAN networks in the market today, LoRaWAN has been largely adopted and shows great potential for growth in the upcoming years. In this paper, it is presented an implementation of a LoRaWAN radio link in order to evaluate its physical layer and its coexistence performance. The LoRa modulation/demodulation process is described based on packets captured using a software defined radio. The robustness of the protocol against wide band interferers is investigated through a coexistence experiment done in a confined environment.

Approaches to secure data generated in the sensors until the user's application is a challenging task. This paper discusses how the SWAMP project is dealing with end-to-end security and technologies for the application of IoT in agriculture.",2019,10,0,10.1109/LADC48089.2019.8995724,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/df5ce4fe26eaebc8f9caab9740c566366e8d6687,JournalArticle,Latin-American Symposium on Dependable Computing
dfbd91d9dd07baef2e4d1dcbf40327762505bc84,A spectral imaging system for precision agriculture: From its inception till a pre-commercial prototype,"New trends in the development of tools and strategies to optimize the productivity of agricultural fields have led to exciting opportunities based on a combination of two key technologies: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and spectral sensors. Both of them come from different domains, the former playing a significant role mainly in military applications, and the latter in the space sector. UAVs and earth observation satellites represent the two extremes of monitoring systems in which airborne and High Altitude Pseudo Satellites (HAPS) are located in the middle range. From these four options, UAVs represent a good compromise between cost, performance and ease of operation in their numerous civil and environmental applications. However, they are also very challenging mainly due to the integration of specific payload which requires engineering experience in optics, electronics, physics and aerodynamics. In this paper, a hyperspectral UAV platform is presented, detailing every decision adopted since its inception for its use in precision agriculture, solving the problems encountered in its construction and developing an ad-hoc application to control the flight trajectory and manage data acquisition optimizing its battery limitations. The result is a robust autonomous system tested in a real scenario to monitor the health status of a vineyard in just a few minutes, based on different Vegetation Indices (VIs), reducing the time and efforts employed by traditional farmers and opening new avenues in the management of agricultural production and environmental respect.",2019,1,0,10.1109/DCIS201949030.2019.8959891,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dfbd91d9dd07baef2e4d1dcbf40327762505bc84,"JournalArticle,Conference",Conference on Design of Circuits and Integrated Systems
e7f63f8d596925c3bd860d71b17d161cfe332c33,Emerging UAV Applications in Agriculture,"Climate change is impacting the agriculture sector hence heavy threatening global food security. Farmers have to adapt and introduce technologies to enhance their decision making using reliable, accurate and timely information. Unlike the expensive satellites, UAVs equipped with a set of specific sensors and instruments have a huge potential supporting agriculture in evidence-based planning and spatial data collection. Thus, the overall goal of this paper is to provide a panoramic about the current status of the emerging use of UAVs in the Agriculture area and present a generic example in one of the application areas with system design and component selection.

685760667e3c75f59bc4726911ef1c39e63530a5,When accuracy of measurements matter: economic profitability from precision agriculture,"Starting from 1980s, Precision Agriculture (PA) has established itself as a modern farming management using digital techniques to monitor and optimize agricultural production processes. However, the debate about the relative magnitude of benefits and costs of PA technologies on individual farms is still going on. The profitability of precision agriculture depends on part of the spatial and temporal variability of the soil and on the other hand on the accuracy with which the measurements are made. On this premise, the present paper aims, firstly, to review the state of art of the economic profitability of PA, in relation to the technology adopted. Secondly to explore how Precision Agriculture Technologies could affect the productivity of a representative farm specialized in arable crop production. This study confirms the positive effect related to the application of Precision Agriculture Technologies (PATs).",2019,0,0,10.1109/MetroAgriFor.2019.8909240,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/685760667e3c75f59bc4726911ef1c39e63530a5,Review,2019 IEEE International Workshop on Metrology for Agriculture and Forestry (MetroAgriFor)
